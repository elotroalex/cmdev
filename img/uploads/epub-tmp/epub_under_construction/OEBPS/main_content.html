Indeed.

I am becoming a big fan of the various domino scenarios the administration brings out. Pakistan / Afghanistan / Taliban or Iraq / Syria / Iran / restofthemiddleeast.
States capitulate and change course because the comprehensive game plan of the administration leaves them no recourse. When is Iraq inviting Syria and Iran for democracy sleep-overs?

Both of these articles point towards external and internal reform pressures on the madrasa system. The impression is that the madrasas teach nothing besides the rote memorization of the Qur'an (picture boys in caps on floor swaying back and forth). The further implication is that the madrasa system in Pakistan is a breeding ground of terror and extremism. Hence, reform must come by reforming the curriculum of these schools.

As Bush/Musharraf spoke in a<!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://usembassy-australia.state.gov/hyper/2002/0213/epf301.htm">2002 press conference</a>:

</p><!-- copied at 1 --><div  id="blockquoted">PRESIDENT BUSH: Let me first -- and I'd like the President to speak on this, basically on the madrasa school issue in Pakistan. One of the things that most impressed me about President Musharraf, that gives me confidence in his vision, is that the last time we met in New York City, we spent a fair amount of time talking about education reform. And the President has placed a very intriguing and very interesting woman in charge of the education system in Pakistan. She used to work in rural areas, a rural province of the country. He's elevated her to Cabinet position because she's a reformer. She understands the modern world requires an education system that trains children in basic sciences and reading and math and the history of Pakistan. [snip]

PRESIDENT MUSHARRAF: Madrasas, we must understand, are basically -- there are about 600,000 to 800,000 students here in madrasas. Now, the positive aspect of the madrasa -- which I did lay out in my speech also, I would like to highlight for everyone to hear -- is that they are a welfare -- they have a welfare and humanitarian aspect to them. They feed and house the poorest of the poor children. So this is the positive aspect of their providing free board and lodge to the poorest of the poor. Now, the weaknesses of some of the madrasas only teaching religious -- giving religious education to the children has to be removed. And the children in these madrasas need to be brought into the mainstream of life. And that is what we are doing. </div>



The word "Madrasa" comes from the same arabic root as "dars" which means a lesson or a lecture. With the famous dictum to "pursue knowledge, even if it takes you to China", the role of education has been central in any Islamic polity. Madrasa, as  traditionally constructed in Islam, is an institution where any one of the four schools of religion in Islam - the <!-- copied at 1 --><em >madhhab</em> - along with Arabic grammar, the traditions of the Prophet -<!-- copied at 1 --><em >hadith</em>, history, literature, rhetoric, mathematics, and astronomy are taught. They emerged in the early tenth century in Iran although we have reports as early as 'Abdul Malik (c.685-705) of Quranic teachings done in two type of settings:

 - The first was the <!-- copied at 1 --><em >maktab</em> which was geared towards the illiterate and primarily to teach the Qur'an. This was done anywhere - private house, shop etc. presided over by an <!-- copied at 1 --><em >alim</em>. 

 - The second was the <!-- copied at 1 --><em >majlis</em>, which rose out of a gathering of scholars in the mosque and was dedicated to more specialized study. 



There are the famous examples of funded institutions of higher learning such as al-Rashid's (c.764Ã¢ÂÂ 809) <!-- copied at 1 --><em >Bait ul Hikmah</em> (house of wisdom). Other examples are the <!-- copied at 1 --><em >Jami'a Masjids</em> - large mosques - that served as centers of learning. The chief among them being the <!-- copied at 1 --><em >Masjid al-Haram </em> in Mecca that was seen as the most sacred institute. Figures such as Shah Waliullah, Abdul Wahab, Ubaidullah Sindhi studied here in the early 19th century. 



The establishment of the current model of the madrasa can be traced to Nizam ul Mulk (c.1018Ã¢ÂÂ 92), the Grand Vizier under two Seljuk Sultans. He wrote the influential <!-- copied at 1 --><em >Siyasat Namah</em> - The Book of Government and founded a series of madrasas all over Iraq and Khurusan (Iran). The biggest of the them was the Nazimiya in Baghdad (c.1065). In his book, as in the establishment of these madrasas, Nizam ul Mulk sought to train a cadre of intellectuals and theologians that would guide the Sultans in their governance over the Muslim lands. Nizam ul Mulk's reforms instituted a state-funded (through <!-- copied at 1 --><em >waqf</em> - land endownment) institute of higher learning that was responsible for creating a new elite. 



The madrasa system spread throughout Fatimid and Mamluk Egypt, Iraq, Safavid Iran and India. In India, the Delhi sultanate and the Mughals continued their patronage of madrasas all over the land. They served as counter-balances in some areas (such as Bengal) to the ever-popular Sufi Khanaqas (communal housing and learning centers). The importance of fiqh (religious law), history, sciences was well established by the 16th and 17th centuries. The 'alims who came out of these madrasas were polyglot, erudite intellectuals who sought high offices. 



The British in India were responsible for both the diminuation of the syllabi of madrasas as well as their spread as a counter-British institution. After the 1857 war, the language of the courts was shifted from Persian to English. The Muslim elites who were trained at home and in madrasas in the "classical" subjects were loathe to join the english grammar schools. While people like <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.ssuet.edu.pk/sirsyed/main.html"> Syed Ahmed Khan</a>, argued for a modernization of the Islamic knowledge systems and founded Aligarh University in 1864. Others like Thanawi, Maududi, Nanotovi etc. opted for enshrining Arabic and the Qur'an at the heart of any system of Muslim knowledge in India. The effect was the growth of two separate strains of Muslim thought in India. In pre-colonial India, the 'alim had to know fiqh, history, sciences, archery etc. to be an effective administrator or jurist, but the colonial counterpart needed only English language and English Law. As a reult, the curriculums in the madrasas deteriorated down to just religious law. 



Children were sent to madrasas in their earliest age to learn to read the Qur'an and other religious rituals. A minority, only those persuing a religious living, went on to studying fiqh etc. and the rest went to public or private secular schools. The madrasas existed not in competition with secular Urdu, Hindi or English medium schools but as optional supplements.



In the 80s, the Afghani conflict forced the migration of millions of refugees into Pakistan. The madrasas were one venue where children and young adults found refuge. The got home and boarding and were schooled in Qur'an and Arabic. This is the time-frame where the politicization and militarization of the madrasas in rural and semi-urban regions of Pakistan. It was NOT a uniform phenomenon and neither was it a programmed one. Many have pointed to <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.storyofpakistan.com/person.asp?perid=P020">Zia ul Haq's</a> Islamization as responsible for this but I would like to differ mainly because the state control over these institutions has been virtually negligible. 



There is no doubt though that, in the 90s, hardline jihadi talk was gaining momentum in the madrasas in Pakistan - this time due to the Kashmiri conflict. 

Today, the majority of madrasas in Pakistan are tiny nickle and dime operations. Led by one solitary imam in a neighborhood, housed inside a mosque, they are the <!-- copied at 1 --><em >maktabs</em> of early Islam. The powerhouses, like the <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://ashrafia.org.pk/">Jamia Ashrafia</a> are too prominent to openly preach jihad. The culprits are the madrasas run <!-- copied at 1 --><b >by</b> jihadist organizations themselves. To stop them, one needs to root out the organizations such as Jaish Muhammad etc. It is common knowledge which are of the madrasas that are the radical ones. Taking away the funding of such organizations will do enough to break such madrasas. The neighborhood ones will never have the funds or personnel to "modernize". They exist not to trains jihadists but to teach children Arabic and the Qur'an. They <!-- copied at 1 --><em >are</em> regulated in the sense that the neighborhood hires the imam who leads the prayer and teaches there. These imams have to conform to the local standards and ideologies and radical ones are often booted out -- at least in Lahore.

This is a shameful example of rapine and killing carried out in the name of "honor" in rural Pakistan. Neither of these events is unique and one must look at their tortured historical past in Pakistan.

<!-- copied at 1 --><b>Shi'a-Sunni Conflict in Pakistan</b>
Who will lead the Muslim community? That question of political authority and legitimacy split the nascent Muslim world right after the death of the Prophet. For the Shi'a, the Companions of the Prophet conspired to disposses 'Ali (his son-in-law) of his rightful claim as the First Caliph. The Sunni majority - that revered the Companions - feels that political succession of the Prophet went as God intended. The history of Islam bears witness to these two strains developing and solidifying ideologically and politically in various parts of the world. 
In Pakistan, by a rough estimate, the Shi'a community is 20% of the population. Sectarian conflict did not become the issue it is today until the Islamization processes of Gen. Zia ul Haq (1977-1988) the Martial Law Administrator of Pakistan. 
In 1980, as a response to his Islamization policy (and the fear that the Hanafi fiqh will pre-dominate), the Shi'a community began political mobilization. The 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran was a great ideological boon to the community. The organization at the forefront of this mobilization was Tahrik-i Nifaaz Fiqaah Ja'fariyya or Tahrik-i Ja'fariyya (Movement for the Implementation of Ja'faria Law - TJP). Created largely to protect Shi'a community from unfair Islamization laws, the TJP quickly expanded into a full-fledged movement for the Shi'a in Pakistan. Its confrontational style sowed seeds of dismay in the Sunni majority. It's second leader Allama 'Arif Husain al-Husaini was assassinated in 1988.  One of their manifesto items was the creation of an army of followers ready to defend the community. In 1991, that army (or youth group) splintered into the Sipah-i Muhammad (Muhammad's Soldiers). Based out of Thokar Niaz Baig, it participated heavily in the Afghanistan conflict raging against the Soviets as well as Kashmir. The recruitment and training of young men happened mostly in madrasas associated with the organization. Since its inception, this organization has been involved in much of the anti-Sunni violence in Karachi and Punjab. 
The Sunni counterpart is the <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.ict.org.il/inter_ter/orgdet.cfm?orgid=57">Sipah-i Sahaba</a> (Soldiers of the Companions) established in 1985 in Punjab. It was constructed explicitly to combat Shi'a power in Pakistan and to make Sunni Islam the official religion of the state. For example, to counter the Muharram processions, it tried to celebrate the death anniversaries of the first four caliphs. This organization was militarized as well in the Afghanistani and Kashmiri conflicts. 
Beginning in the rural centers, these organization spread to the urban populations in the mid-90s and brought with them their militant sectarianism. There were over 1800 events of sectarian violence between 1984-2003 with deaths and injuries of considerable population. There are further splinter groups of these organizations as well (most have been tagged 'terrorist' by Gen. Musharraf).
The flare-ups happen largely around Muharram with one or the other organization attacking mosques or neighborhoods with drive-by shootings. The suicide bomb that caused this latest incident seems to be a new development. A particularly shameful chapter in this bloody history was the <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://yespakistan.com/security/anwar.asp"> assassinations of Shi'a medical professionals </a> in Karachi in 2002. They had a hitlist of doctors with Shi'a sounding names who were stalked and shot. The retaliation by the Shi'a resulted in the <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://newsline.com.pk/NewsOct2003/stopoct1.htm">assassination of Maulana Azim Tariq</a> (a leader of the Sipah Sahaba) in 2003. Which caused further retaliation. 
As long as Pakistan continues to yolk itself to any conception of an Islamic State, it will have no recourse against those willing to hijack the whole bus. Zia's Islamization (Nizam-i Mustafa as he called it) may have been the catalyst for militarization of such groups, but the subsequent "civilian" governments did nothing to stop the madness. In fact, Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif continued to promote relationships with these organizations to get access to local legitimacy.
I am afraid that the only way out is to remove the shroud of Islam from the state mantle.

<!-- copied at 1 --><b>Honor Crimes</b>:
Let's go from the evils of state and religion to the evils of class and culture. Honor crimes are not Pakistani or Islamic in nature (ever read Shakespeare?). They are <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.gendercide.org/">crimes against women</a> in every patriarchical, feudal society. They arise out of cultures and histories where women are possessions. In Pakistan, according to an editorial by Munnu Bhai in today's Jang Daily, there were 1261 incidents of honor crimes in 2003. The pre-dominant cases involve the landed elite of the village raping and killing the lower classes and imposing their terror upon that society. In this case, as well, the Zamindar (land owner) claimed an individual had illicit relations with his daughter and as compensation demanded the right to rape the two sisters of that individual. He was given the right to do so by a Panchiayat - a group of five elders who traditionally play the role of judge and jury in rural villages. In fact, the Panchiayats are nothing more than rubber stamps of the evil will of the landowners. The "wise elders" in this case are on the lam from the law as is the rapist. Will they be bought to justice? I think so. The best way to get things done right in Pakistan nowadays is to get international media involved.
Still, the root of the problem remains. Feudal landlords who rule over their dominion like mini-Stalins.  
I have an even more prepostorous solution for that: Land Reform and a viable movement to better the role of women in Pakistani society ESPECIALLY in the rural areas.

&#13;
I gave this poem to my South Asia Civ class in the Fall and asked for their response. Most had heard of the phrase "The White Man's Burden". Most had a negative opinion of this poem after reading it, despite having little knowledge of the conquest of Philippines or the historical debate on Imperialism produced in the aftermath of that savage war. &#13;
Listening to George Bush's press conference, I was reminded of that debate and how similiar it is to the War on Terror/War for Freedom rhetoric nowadays. Just as the War on Terror masks wars on civil liberties or constitutional rights or sovereign nations, the calls for Freedom railroads the actual meaning of that term. The French are horrible because they are free to choose and they choose to be against us. The Spanish should hand the Iberian peninsula back to the Moors because they elected to get out of Iraq. You are free to choose as long as you choose what we want you to choose.&#13;
 &#13;
Freedom, indeed, is a genuine human right as Bush eloquently puts it:&#13;
&#13;
</p><!-- copied at 1 --><div  id="blockquoted">&gt;Some of the debate really centers around the fact that people don't believe Iraq can be free, that if you're <!-- copied at 1 --><strong> Muslim or perhaps brown skinned</strong>, you can't be self-governing and free.

The backlash specifically <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/idcard/uk/id-terrorism.pdf">counters the claim</a> [pdf] that ID cards will deter terrorists (I have yet to hear about terrorists faking identities). 
I remember Dean taking all kinds of flack because he mentioned something about a National ID card. In Pakistan, we have had ID cards forever (as in most of Europe and Asia) and I know that my uncles had about 6 a piece - with different names and pictures. My uncles were no terrorists. They are not even shady. The multiple ID cards were used to get out of parking tickets and cast multiple votes in student elections in their college. Of course, that was long ago and the new <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.nadra.gov.pk/cnic.html">NID card in Pakistan </a> has some biometric (?) data and a spiffy website. So, presumably, that kind of abuse no longer takes place.
I think that National ID card will debut very soon after the Bush re-election. Larry Ellison is <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.wired.com/news/conflict/0,2100,47788,00.html?tw=wn_story_related"> chomping at the bits </a> to put his Oracle db to the backend and have a national ID. Ashcroft, who hated the idea of gun owners having to register, is on board. 
My small contribution to this debate is to merge the CAPPS II rating system with the ID card. Look at your driver's license. On the front, it has a "class" listing which pertains to whether you use corrective lenses. That should be the terrorist rating you get from the CAPPS II. Help the police out. I am AAB, btw, which means I get checked manually on the terror list each time I board a plane. But I do NOT get body cavity search. WOO HOO.</div></div><div class="library-item"><h3 class="library-item-title">Shame</h3><div class="library-item-content"><!-- copied at 1 --><p >The Iraqi <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/iraqis_tortured/">prisoner abuse </a>story is extremely significant. It is a devastating blow to any notion of winning the hearts and minds of Arabs in or outside of Iraq. Most <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/05/01/iraq.prisoner.reax/index.html">newspapers </a>are carrying stories on outrage in Cairo, UAE, Bahrain.

 &#13;
What is the significance? In the Islamic world, home to dictatorships and police regimes, this is not newsworthy solely because it happened. Instead, it has immense symbolic power because the perpetrators are those that have had the rhetoric of "good" vs evil. Those that claimed that it is civilization they bring to the people. And freedom, of course. Even more than that, is the content of these pictures. If there is one thing valued higher than life, it is honor. The pictures of naked Iraqi prisoners in a pile or in sexual position, and being ridiculed by a white female soldier screams to the Arab and muslim public that their honor has been stripped bare. Shame is in the unveiling. &#13;

A world that knows it has been militarily, economically, culturally and politically dominated by the West, now stares at pictures confirming their worst fears. The power of images need not be overly stressed as images like the <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://dir.salon.com/books/feature/2000/08/03/chong/index.html"> little vietnamese girl</a>,  or the <!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://pekingduck.org/archives/000935.php">Tiananmen Square man </a> etc. are stark examples of visceral impact on the public mood. In the Arab psyche, the humility of 1967 was far greater than the military defeat of 1967. Similar was the symbolic shame of having non-Muslim troops in Saudi Arabia defending Mecca from Saddam for certain Muslims. These images have the potential to wreck the same havoc.&#13;
&#13;
And no, I am not reading TOO much into it. And no, it is NOT worse than Saddam's "rape houses" - as our president is fond of saying. It is NOT. &#13;
I am talking about cultural memory and self-image. This war on terrah is a war for the hearts and minds, no?

</p><!-- copied at 1 --><div  id="blockquoted">The photographs tell it all. In one, Private England, a cigarette dangling from her mouth, is giving a jaunty thumbs-up sign and pointing at the genitals of a young Iraqi, who is naked except for a sandbag over his head, as he masturbates. Three other hooded and naked Iraqi prisoners are shown, hands reflexively crossed over their genitals. A fifth prisoner has his hands at his sides. In another, England stands arm in arm with Specialist Graner; both are grinning and giving the thumbs-up behind a cluster of perhaps seven naked Iraqis, knees bent, piled clumsily on top of each other in a pyramid. There is another photograph of a cluster of naked prisoners, again piled in a pyramid. Near them stands Graner, smiling, his arms crossed; a woman soldier stands in front of him, bending over, and she, too, is smiling. Then, there is another cluster of hooded bodies, with a female soldier standing in front, taking photographs. Yet another photograph shows a kneeling, naked, unhooded male prisoner, head momentarily turned away from the camera, posed to make it appear that he is performing oral sex on another male prisoner, who is naked and hooded.&#13;
Such dehumanization is unacceptable in any culture, but it is especially so in the Arab world. Homosexual acts are against Islamic law and it is humiliating for men to be naked in front of other men, Bernard Haykel, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at New York University, explained.

Say what? End of Enlightenement? You think this will "also spur an intense clash of civilizations, a prospect I had until very recently rejected. "? Wow. Not you too!
Iraq war was stupidly launched. Iraq war was stupidly managed. Iraq war will generate hundreds more terrorist wanna-be playas. I agree with all those whole-heartedly. But, to say that the Project of Enlightenement itself will perish!? I have news for you, Ms. Wright. The Project of Enlightenement is gasping for breath in the United States, itself. Your President talks to God. Your Congress fears Gay Union will end Civilization. Your country is holding hundreds of people without any recourse to legal aid and in extreme duress. It incarcerates more people than any other society on the planet. Racial or sexual equality is still a "goal" for the society. Your last election was stolen by a junta. I mean, I can go on here but you get the picture. Don't start crying about this precious Enlightenement that launched the Modern Era and will perish because of some Arab tyrannts. You want to save a clash of civilization? One clue: It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

How about we try a whole new appoach? How about we stop messing with the progress of Modern Era by upholding dictators and commanding policy? How about we actually try to give Palestinians a homeland and aid to build a society after 60 years? How about we let Islamic governments be Islamic governments and not think that all theocracies are created equal. Because, the truth is Robin, there are many Enlightenements and many Modern Eras. The one being exported by the barrel of a gun in Iraq is not gonna be the one the Iraqis live with in 2 years or 5. They will construct their own. 
So, please, be hopeful. Make your government answer to its people. Let the Iraqis answer to themselves.</div></div><div class="library-item"><h3 class="library-item-title">Chalabi Hits The Fan</h3><div class="library-item-content"><div class="anthologize-image-wrapper"><img src="chalabi.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="6"/></div>I am in the midst of reading a <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=8-0802141242-0"> book</a> that is blowing my mind away [review later]. As a historian, I am trained to eschew the individual-centered approach to history - to focus, instead, on processes and ideas. However, the book and the scandal swiveling around Ahmad Chalabi are a keen reminder of the role played by individuals as both instruments of change and inertia.   
<!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Ahmed_Chalabi">Ahmad Chalabi</a> is a '69 Mathematics PhD from <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0306/alumni/lines.shtml">UChicago</a> [where he studied with Albert Wohlstetter], a founder of Petra Bank in Jordan accused of <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.gulf-news.com/Articles/news.asp?ArticleID=87392">swindling $200 millions </a> from the Jordanians [he escaped in the trunk of a palace limo],  a man who sold Iraqi resistance to a wide-eyed Congress in 1998 and got hundreds of millions to fund it, and an installed President of the Iraqi Governing Council widely thought to be elected first President of Iraq [without any popular support]. And now, on Paul Bremer's shit list.
So, how did Mr. Chalabi do all that? He was the right man at the right moment with the right pipe-dream. To Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle and Doug Feith, sweating the Dark Ages during the Clinton Years, he was a former classmate who could deliver Iraq to them. So they latched on to him with a religious fervor, knowing that he will point to the WMDs. Sure that he had the inside scoop on Iraqi Freedom Fighters. In the post-war, they knew he can be trusted to lead Iraq as the First Democracy while remaining true to the First Empire. As Bernard Lewis, the current intellectual fountainhead for the neo-cons, wrote in a WSJ editorial in 2003, he is <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110003937">the only hope</a> for Iraq. 
Ahmad Chalabi is a Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy for Iran, says the US now. Surely, this "accusation" comes from ComCent. Is it a squeeze? Was he about to go public with some WMD after being shoved aside for U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi? I am inclined to think that this is a pre-emptive strike to discredit him and cast his "revelations" as a disgruntled ex-employee.
The question is, When Will he Sing?
He is headed back to Washington to confront his "critics". He will have some words for Dick Cheney's ears. And, once he realizes that his con is truly up, he will start the endgame: a 60 Minutes Special...

British society has had a stranger path to integration than most. On the one hand, the metropolis was always open for the "bright" natives who came to get civilized and educated. On the other hand, the natives were there to get civilized and educated - which meant not being so uncouth as to dress or act differently from the OxCam crowd. The massive Indian immigration after WWII (and Indian independence) though was a different affair. The migrants during the booming reconstruction of 50s and 60s Britain duly felt themselves to be "second class citizens" and congregated in socially cohesive neighborhoods. The subsequent generations of British Indians or Pakistanis have had intermittent successes in integrating. Sure, everyone in Britain loves <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.thecurryguide.co.uk/">curry</a> and kababs, the English novel <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/hay/story/0,14559,1228130,00.html">is saved by</a>brown people, <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://england.asinah.net/en/wikipedia/m/mu/music_of_the_united_kingdom.html#Indian%20music">bhangra</a> is king BUT there is <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.geog.psu.edu/courses/geog100/NYTimes/121201britlife.html">no integration</a> of the wider ethnic communities into British life. 

Hence, it is not surprising that the British Muslim youth find themselves at loggerhead with their homeland. The hate-preachers have a receptive audience and a welcoming, universal identity for these kids. The racism, though, has a even deadlier consequence that the Report highlighted:
<!-- copied at 1 --><div  class="quote"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="anthologize-image-wrapper"><img src="startquote.gif"/></div>The most subtle and for Muslims perilous consequence of Islamophobic actions,ÃÂ a Muslim scholar has observed, ÃÂ¥is the silencing of self-criticism and the slide into defending the indefensible. Muslims decline to be openly critical of fellow Muslims, their ideas, activities and rhetoric in mixed company, lest this be seen as giving aid and comfort to the extensive forces of condemnation. Brotherhood, fellow feeling, sisterhood are genuine and authentic reflexes of Islam.

Actually, I just saw this great page, <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.americanprogress.org/site/pp.asp?c=biJRJ8OVF&amp;b=42263">Flip-Flopper-In-Chief</a> where you can read # 14 yourself. Why was OBL dropped as Public Enemy #1? Because Bush wanted Saddam? Let's assume that the truth is more complex than that. The rhetoric from the Bush administration about the War on Terror has been that this is a "new" reality that has "fundamentally changed" the world. However, their actions belie that rhetoric. 

Remember, that the Bush thinkforce pre-dominantly contains Cold War veterans and Soviet "experts". The reigning model for world conflict for the past 60 years has been aggression by the State which will need a superior power to counteract or counterbalance. In Winter 2001, that idea held on - there was a direct relationship between the Taliban (the State) and al-Qaeda (the nonstate actor) - and Afghanistan was invaded. 

Now, if the War on Terror was indeed a "new" mode of operation, the Bush administration would have shifted their focus to combating various terrorist organizations through economic, clandestine and military-coop ways in various countries. Perhaps build a new coalition agency (like the Interpol) that could operate internationally and develop legislations in various countries to effectively combat terrorism. 

The thinking should have been that these nonstate actors may take funds from certain States, they may even operate in those States but they do not <!-- copied at 1 --><b >represent</b> the interests of any given State. Their agenda is their own and unique and it may dovetail here or there with a State but that is coincidental not conspiratorial. But the Bush Administration went on with the same-old Cold War mentalitÃÂ. Invade Iraq because they supported al-Qaeda is the latest iteration of that rationale. It remains just as false as the WMD claim but that is not what I want to quibble with here. 

According to the Statist model, it makes sense that Osama is not a priority. What difference does it make whether he is captured or not. Unless, of course, the difference is between getting Mr. Bush re-elected. The New Republic has a report entitled <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20040719&amp;s=aaj071904">July Surprise</a>, that claims that the Bush administration has been pressuring Pakistan to deliver a <!-- copied at 1 --><i >High Value target</i> (HVT) <!-- copied at 1 --><b >before</b> November -in fact - during the Democratic Convention:

<!-- copied at 1 --><div  class="quote"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="anthologize-image-wrapper"><img src="startquote.gif"/></div>A third source, an official who works under ISI's director, Lieutenant General Ehsan ul-Haq, informed tnr that the Pakistanis "have been told at every level that apprehension or killing of HVTs before [the] election is [an] absolute must." What's more, this source claims that Bush administration officials have told their Pakistani counterparts they have a date in mind for announcing this achievement: "The last ten days of July deadline has been given repeatedly by visitors to Islamabad and during [ul-Haq's] meetings in Washington." Says McCormack: "I'm aware of no such comment." But according to this ISI official, a White House aide told ul-Haq last spring that "it would be best if the arrest or killing of [any] HVT were announced on twenty-six, twenty-seven, or twenty-eight July"--the first three days of the Democratic National Convention in Boston. <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="anthologize-image-wrapper"><img src="endquote.gif"/></div></div>

That Osama's capture will increase Bush's chance of re-election is a dubious claim. And from the way <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.paifamily.com/opinion/archives/000880.html">things have been going in Wana</a>, it is highly debatable that Musharraf can deliver Osama on such a timetable.

The State Dept. had earlier given him a visa to teach at Notre Dame's <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.nd.edu/~krocinst/">Kroc Institute for Peace Studies</a> but, last week, after a tip from DHS, they revoked the visa citing, "aliens who have used a position of prominence within any country to endorse or espouse terrorist activity" cannot enter the US. 

Mr. Ramadan is a well-published, well-scrutinized, public figure. If he had any ties to terrorists or was a terrorist, there would be clear evidence. There is not a whiff of that. What he is, is a liberal (or progressive or modern or whatever) Islamic intellectual - and, oh boy, there are about 4 of those around. For a debate on Ramadan's Islamic cred see <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://abuaardvark.typepad.com/abuaardvark/2004/08/ramadan.html">Abu Aadvark</a> [click through to his earlier posts]. 

The general take on all this is that Daniel Pipes [<!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1028113,00.html">scholar of peace</a>] and his ilk (campuswatch.org) raised alarms and someone in DHS bought that nonsense. I don't know enough about that. Pipes did write a <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.danielpipes.org/article/867">favorable review</a> of Ramadan's book in 2000 and disavows having anything to do in this matter. Whoever or whatever group did it - it amounts to plain and simple censorship and suppression of ideas.

All that summarization to make one simple point: Which voices of Islam are legitimate in the US public sphere? Who does the DHS think should be allowed to speak or teach about Islam? Who can criticize Israel and not be branded anti-Semitic terrorist? Where can DHS find a Muslim voice they approve of? As an academic, all I can gather from this episode is that the only legitimate form of discourse on Islam is one that is lopsidedly critical, bereft of any substantive engagement with modern political realities and praiseworthy of US imperial designs. I am disgusted. Ramadan was supposed to speak at next month's ISNA gathering and I was all psyched to go attend. It would have been my first ISNA. There were a few other public lectures that he was giving...oh well. As long as we win the War on Terror.

ByÃ¢ÂÂ TARIQ RAMADAN
Globe and Mail Update

POSTED AT 1:18 AM EDT
Monday, Aug 30, 2004. In my 20 years of studying and teaching philosophy, I have learned to appreciate the inherent difficulty in defining and recognizing "the truth." Descartes put it simply: "A clear and obvious idea is true"; Kant aptly added "consistency" as a needed element. My life experience over the past 15 years enabled me to appreciate yet another definition.

In today's world of communication and mass media, truth is not firstly based on coherence and clarity, but rather on frequency. Here, a repeated hypothesis or suspicion becomes a truth; a three-time-repeated assumption imperceptibly becomes a fact. There is no need to check because "it is obvious"; after all, "we have heard it many times" and "it is being said everywhere."

Lately, I have been going through an interesting experience. I am constantly being told "the truth" about who I am: "You are a controversial figure"; "you engage in double-talk, delivering a gentle message in French and English, and a radical - even extremist - one in Arabic, or to a Muslim audience in private"; "you have links with extremists, you are an anti-Semite"; "you despise women" etc.

When I ask about the source of this information, invariably the response is: This is well-known, it is everywhere, check the Internet and you will find thousands of pages referring to this.

A closer examination reveals that what we have is journalists or intellectuals quoting each other, conclusively reporting and infinitely repeating what others said yesterday, with caveats. Rather than using this as an occasion for reflection, the response to this finding is usually: "Well, there has to be some truth in all that."

Strange truth, indeed! I have written more than 20 books and about 800 articles; 170 tapes of lectures are circulating, and I keep asking my detractors: Have you read or listened to any of my material? Can you prove your allegations? To repeat them is not to prove. Where is the evidence of my double-talk? Have you read any of the numerous articles where I call on Muslims to unequivocally condemn radical views and acts of extremism?

How about my statements of Sept. 13, 2001, calling on Muslims to speak out, to condemn the terrorist attacks and acknowledge that some fellow Muslims are betraying the Islamic message?

What about the articles in which I condemn anti-Semitism, criticizing those Muslims who do not differentiate between the political Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the unacceptable temptation to reject the Jews simply because they are Jews?

Are you familiar with my chapters and taped lectures promoting women's rights and a revival leading to an Islamic feminism, and rejecting every kind of mistreatment (domestic violence, forced marriage, female circumcision etc.) and all sorts of discrimination?

Finally, are you acquainted with my extensive study of the Islamic scriptural sources and efforts to promote a new understanding, a new way for Muslims to remain faithful to their principles and, at the same time, able to face the challenges of the contemporary world?

To seek "the truth," one must read, listen carefully, check and recheck for clarity and consistency, and be willing, if for a moment, to be decentred. Very often, even within the academic field, I encounter individuals who are not familiar with my writings. When this becomes obvious in the course of discussion, their final argument is: "Well, aren't you the grandson of Hassan Al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood?" As if this was sufficient proof of all the allegations.

My response is: So what? And what do you really know about him and his life history anyway? Furthermore, are one's thoughts genetically transmitted or do one's morals and ethics descend from the vices or virtues of one's pedigree? This obsession with my genealogy is frankly disconcerting, for it is dismissive. Those so focused on my genealogy should examine my intellectual pedigree, which along with my grandfather and father includes Descartes, Kant and Nietzsche.

They should know my academic contributions and the years I spent travelling and working in partnership and on the ground with Dom Helder Camara, the Dalai Lama, Mother Teresa, Abbot Pierre and the countless ordinary people from Canada, South America, Asia, Africa, Europe and America; Christians and Jews; agnostics and atheists. For 20 years, each has educated me, touched my heart, nourished my soul, shaped my mind and strengthened my faith and conviction. That, and not my genetic heritage, is my life's legacy. Along the way, I have learnt that something was missing in Descartes's way of speaking about truth. Clarity and consistency are not enough: The quest for truth requires deep humility and uncompromising effort. My experience of living with people of different religions, origins and cultures taught me that one will never be at peace with the other if one is at war with oneself.

This simple truth is the essence of my message to Muslims throughout the world: Know who you are, who you want to be, and start talking and working with whom you are not. Find common values and build with your fellow citizens a society based on diversity and equality. The very moment you understand that there are no contradictions between being a Muslim and being an American or a European, you enrich your society.

Promote, from where you are, the universal principles of justice and freedom and leave the societies elsewhere to find their own model of democracy based on their collective psychology and cultural heritage. The path ahead is long and difficult, but there is no other way to succeed except to break our intellectual ghettos, to work together beyond our narrow belonging, and to foster mutual trust in the absence of which living together is nearly impossible. The quest for truth individually and collectively demands research, never judging without studying, clarity, consistency, trust, humility and perseverance.

My move to America and my post at the University of Notre Dame were to enable me to promote and to share this message with Muslim communities and fellow citizens: Is this a threatening contribution? Is it not a needed and urgent message in America in the post-Sept. 11 world?

I think it is. Anyways, she is visiting US (I guess they forgot to cancel her visa) and gave a speech entitled <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.democracynow.org/2004/8/23/public_power_in_the_age_of">Public Power in the Age of Empire</a>. The speech, in line with her recent public discourse, is largely a challenge to both global capitalism and liberal democracy. They talking about a revolution? you ask. But, of course:&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >So when we speak of "Public Power in the Age of Empire," I hope it's not presumptuous to assume that the only thing that is worth discussing seriously is the power of a dissenting public. A public which disagrees with the very concept of empire. A public which has set itself against incumbent power - international, national, regional, or provincial governments and institutions that support and service empire.&#13;
&#13;
What are the avenues of protest available to people who wish to resist empire? By resist I don't mean only to express dissent, but to effectively force change. Empire has a range of calling cards. It uses different weapons to break open different markets. You know the check book and the cruise missile.&#13;
For poor people in many countries, Empire does not always appear in the form of cruise missiles and tanks, as it has in Iraq or Afghanistan or Vietnam. It appears in their lives in very local avatars - losing their jobs, being sent unpayable electricity bills, having their water supply cut, being evicted from their homes and uprooted from their land. All this overseen by the repressive machinery of the state, the police, the army, the judiciary. It is a process of relentless impoverishment with which the poor are historically familiar. What Empire does is to further entrench and exacerbate already existing inequalities.</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
And what would Roy do if she couldn't stir some righteous controversy?&#13;
<!-- copied at 1 --><blockquote >There is no discussion taking place in the world today that is more crucial than the debate about strategies of resistance. And the choice of strategy is not entirely in the hands of the public. It is also in the hands of sarkar.&#13;
&#13;
After all, when the U.S. invades and occupies Iraq in the way it has done, with such overwhelming military force, can the resistance be expected to be a conventional military one? (Of course, even if it were conventional, it would still be called terrorist.) In a strange sense, the U.S. government's arsenal of weapons and unrivalled air and fire power makes terrorism an all-but-inescapable response. What people lack in wealth and power, they will make up with stealth and strategy. In this restive, despairing time, if governments do not do all they can to honor nonviolent resistance, then by default they privilege those who turn to violence. No government's condemnation of terrorism is credible if it cannot show itself to be open to change by to nonviolent dissent.&#13;
But instead nonviolent resistance movements are being crushed. Any kind of mass political mobilization or organization is being bought off, or broken, or simply ignored.</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
Now the thing is that Roy is one of the chief idealogues of the protest movements on the left (Zinn, Chomsky etc. has-beens) and I know that this speech is all over the various email lists that are congregating people to NYC for next week. I don't always agree with Roy but hers is a voice that needs to be heard and understood. So, please go read the speech.</div></div><div class="library-item"><h3 class="library-item-title">The Realm of Ideas</h3><div class="library-item-content"><div class="anthologize-image-wrapper"><img src="cohen.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="6"/></div>Via Abu Aardvark, I learned about <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www-hoover.stanford.edu/publications/books/practical.html">A Practical Guide to Winning the War on Terrorism</a>. As our fearless leader recently said that <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/5866571/">we may never win the war on terror</a>, I was curious to see what this here practical guide was all about 
(yeah, it's a cheap shot, move on). The guide is indeed filled with notables like Dale Eickleman, Muqtedar Khan, Prince Talal  (my lil'est brother was named after him!), Martin Kramer, Olivier Roy, and Amir Taheri. Oh, I forgot to mention <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.brookings.edu/scholars/scohen.htm">Stephen P. Cohen</a>. It is this gentleman who wrote the piece on Pakistan, entitled, <!-- copied at 1 --><i >With Allies Like This: Pakistan and the War on Terrorism</i>. 

Dr. Cohen is the author of <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&amp;field-author=Cohen%2C%252520Stephen%252520P./104-5916011-7556768">5000</a> books and articles about homistan (remind me some other time to tell you all about the 5000 year joke). He is the "expert". I would call him the Bernard Lewis of South Asia. Yeah, that lame. I have no idea what he is saying half the time but I know that people listen to him, people in power. People in Pakistan hate him because he is pro-India. People in India hate him because he is pro-Pakistan. People in Pakistan love him because he is pro-Pakistan. People in India love him because he is pro-India. They all can cite profusely from his work as evidence for their like/dislike. I am dead serious.
 <!-- copied at 1 --><b >updated below the fold</b>
<!--more-->
How did Dr. Cohen get to such expertitude heights? He got his M.A. in 1959 (or A.M. as we call it) from UChicago with a thesis on US Foreign Policy and Unconditional Surrender. In 1967, he got his Ph.D. from UWisc-Madison on Indian military during the British period. It is unclear to me if he even knows hindi or urdu from glancing at the abstract for his dissertation (his bio says he knows hindi but does not mention urdu which qualifies him to read bupkuss printed in his major field of expertise). He taught at UIUC for a while and then parlayed all that into a successful career with the state dept. and various right-center-right think tanks. He churned out books on India, Indian military, Pakistan, Pakistan military and the rise of the Indian Tiger against the Chinese Dragon (can he get more orientalist?). 

Now, the reason I am telling you all about Dr. Cohen is that after the sub-continent went nuclear in 1999, he became the goto guy. On every talk show, in every op-ed we could find him telling us, <!-- copied at 1 --><i >what it all means</i>. After 9/11, Dr. Cohen's level of expertise rose from military Pakistan to terrorist Pakistan. He has a lot to say and it is mostly, if not entirely, full of horseradish. 

He is the quintessential Occidental "expert" who can pontificate from afar with his cadre of native informants and translators (his collaborator on this piece is a Mr. Moeed Yusuf, a consultant with SDPI). He has no insight. It is half-ass statements and vague generalities ("tie US support of the military with their performance in human rights"). This current piece was filled with all that. US should continue to support the Pakistani military dictator BUT promote democracy. <!-- copied at 1 --><i >Wow. How exactly does that work?</i> It works by promoting secular education and fighting the war on terror in the realm of ideas!
<!-- copied at 1 --><div  class="quote"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="anthologize-image-wrapper"><img src="startquote.gif"/></div>Finally, Washington must take seriously the fact that Pakistan is an important arena of ideas. Most educated Pakistanis are not ideologically anti-American, but they are angry with the United States for changing the regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq and supporting President Musharraf. There is no one telling AmericaÃÂ­s side of the story or engaging its critics in the realm of ideas and public discourse. American information programs in the country are practically nonexistent; these programs need to be revived and vastly expanded, and private organizations must be encouraged to increase their exchange and cultural programs, especially with younger Pakistanis, academics, journalists, and opinion leaders. In the long run the greatest challenge to the United States in Pakistan is in the realm of ideasÃÂ³the field must not be abandoned to Islamic radicals or those who see the United States as an inherently evil state. <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="anthologize-image-wrapper"><img src="endquote.gif"/></div></div>

So, instead of yanking on the General's chain or stop treating the country as your backyard in the proxy war on terrorISM, the US should convince the critics otherwise by hiring their own native experts.

Or the immediate past. They sometimes peek out of their professional masks to say something about current events (or maintain a blog). Rarely, though, do they <!-- copied at 1 --><i >make</i> history. Of course, let me be a geek historian here and name check Juvaini, Rashid ud Din <s >Ibn Rushd</s>, Abu Fazl, Herodotus, etc. who were active participants in making history. But, lately, we don't have that many examples. Except for Bernard Lewis. An Ottomanist who has written 684 bestselling books on Islam and Arabs, defined a foreign policy framework, and, uh, invaded a country. Though, he did say that the Iraqis would greet us with baklavah.



I saw Bernard Lewis on Charlie Rose a few months ago. Right after the Ahmed Chalabi soupan exploded all over nightly news. Lewis, who was the <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110003937">cheerleader-in-charge</a> of Chalabi since forever, defended Chalabi brilliantly - saying his detractors were ignorant pups and evil masterminds in the State Dept. who were working behind the scenes to sabotage the potential Kamal Ataturk of Iraq. After laughing for a solid minute, I cried for an hour. Ladies and Gentlemen, if you would like one man to blame for Iraq: blame the eminent historian <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.princeton.edu/~nes/profiles/Lewis.htm">Bernard Lewis</a>. 



A few months after 9/11, he lectured a gathering of disciples at the VP residence about the Muslims, Koran and What to Do? What did he tell them? Michael Hirsh's <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0411.hirsh.html">piece</a> in the Washington Monthly lays it all out:

<!-- copied at 1 --><div  id="blockquoted&quot;&quot;">Iraq and its poster villain, Saddam Hussein, offered a unique opportunity for achieving this transformation in one bold stroke (remember "shock and awe"?) while regaining the offensive against the terrorists. So, it was no surprise that in the critical months of 2002 and 2003, while the Bush administration shunned deep thinking and banned State Department Arabists from its councils of power, Bernard Lewis was persona grata, delivering spine-stiffening lectures to Cheney over dinner in undisclosed locations. Abandoning his former scholarly caution, Lewis was among the earliest prominent voices after September 11 to press for a confrontation with Saddam, doing so in a series of op-ed pieces in The Wall Street Journal with titles like <!-- copied at 1 --><i>A War of Resolve</i> and <!-- copied at 1 --><i>Time for Toppling.</i> An official who sat in on some of the Lewis-Cheney discussions recalled, 'His view was: 'Get on with it. Don't dither.'</div>



Doug Feith, Richard Perle, Condi Rice, Dick Cheney sitting around a camp fire while Bernard Lewis puts on a shadow-puppet show about the decline and fall of Islamic civilization and the violent response of bearded men to modernity and Britney Spears. And the savior, Ahmed Chalabi.



The role of the academy in the three crucial US-Islam encounters of the long 21st century - Islamic Revolution 1979, Gulf War I 1991, September 11, 2001 - will be the task for future historians. Edward Said called the war-championing academics in 1991 as the Scholar-Combatants. Bernard Lewis, a veteran of WWII, is the prototype (Fouad Ajami being the poor man's version). 



Michael Hirsh points that many Arabists are now setting out to debunk Lewis (like Said never did that) and writing about the cooperation of civilizations instead of clash of civilizations. These critics of Lewis claim that his scholarship is medieval and ossified and he has misread most of Islamic history (if, that is, he actually read it). That he generalizes wrongly and injects his own twisted worldviews without looking at the sources; that he is intent to psychoanalyze a diverse world. So, who is this historian who can have such influence on the elite as well as the public? 



I have never doubted that Lewis knows his history. I am sure he knows more than I do. So, I won't critique his Islamic history (though, I can and, yes, it is quite easy). Instead, let me just talk about his involvement in the imperial project and explain why Edward Said called him the new "Orientalist". Bernard Lewis is a <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.newyorker.com/critics/books/?040614crbo_books">Empirist looking for a King</a> to champion. The end of British Empire after WWII was a greater loss for that generation of British men who served it proudly. Lewis was a wartime British Military Intelligence officer who must have had some cool George Smiley (or T.E. Lawrence) adventures. His posting at Princeton in 1974 timed with the US interests in Iran. During the Carter administration, he devised <!-- copied at 1 --><i >The Bernard Lewis Plan</i> - implemented under the supervision of Zbigniew Brzezinski. And what did the Bernard Lewis Plan entail? Not frequent flyer miles. The plan was based on his idea of an "Arc of Crisis" created around the southern borders of Soviet Union by empowering Muslim radicals to rebel against the communists to bring about the fall of the Soviet Empire. But why Islamic fundamentalists? Why not empower Islamic satirists and engineers? Because, Bernard Lewis has been fascinated with the dull-eyed muslim killing robot remotely controlled by a long-bearded Master all his academic life. This weird obsession with Islamic militarism (and millinasim) goes back to his publication of <!-- copied at 1 --><i ><!-- copied at 1 --><a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/history/0,6121,555621,00.html">The Assassins</a></i> in 1967. The book is a strange work that seems to praise and condemn the Ismaili fanatics at the same time. In a way, he has been talking about wigged-out, fundamentalists clashing with Crusader knights for the last 40 years. Only now, people are listening.



After the Berlin Wall fell and the Cold War ended, the policy wonks needed a new bogey man. In a massively read and cited piece, <!-- copied at 1 --><i >The Roots of Muslim Rage</i>, published in September of 1990 in the Atlantic Monthly, Lewis gave them one by unveiling the "hatred directed against us" in the Muslim world. Just Muslim - not Arab, Indian, Chinese, Caucasian, whatever - Muslim Rage. In it, he first declared that "they hate us" [with no corroboration] and then ran through a litany of almost-explanations: Nazism, Marxism, anti-Semitism, Racism, anti-Imperialism. It is an ingeniously constructed argument, where he listed all of the above reason, gave them some credence but moved on to the next one, finally ending with "a clash of civilizations" [Sam Huntington borrowed it]. The reader, by this time, had almost identified Muslims with nazis, marxists and racists. Which would be enough, you'd think. But there is a grand narrative about to unfold:

<!-- copied at 1 --><div  id="blockquoted">There is something in the religious culture of Islam which inspired, in even the humblest peasant or peddler, a dignity and a courtesy toward others never exceeded and rarely equalled in other civilizations. And yet, in moments of upheavel and disruptions, when the <!-- copied at 1 --><i>deeper passions are stirred</i>, this dignity and courtesy toward others can give way to an explosive mixture of rage and hatred which impels even the government of an ancient and civilized country - even the spokesman of a great spiritual and ethical religion - to espouse kidnapping and assassination, and try to find, in the life of their Prophet, approval and indeed precedent for such actions.



[...]It should by now be clear that we are facing a mood and a movement far transcending the level of issues and policies and the governments that pursue them. This is no less than a clash of civilizations - the perhaps irrational but surely historic reaction of an ancient rival against our Judeo-Christian heritage, our secular present, and the worldwide expansion of both. [<!-- copied at 1 --><i>emphasis mine</i>]</div>



A deep, deep passion against those backhanded compliments and essentializations is stirring in the heart of this plebian. Gulf War I was a catalyst for Middle Eastern scholars to come into the limelight and kick those Cold War polisci profs back to their cubicles. NYT published full page pieces on "Books to Read" to understand the region and its people (and their irrational minds). Bernard Lewis got some books out of all that. In 1992, he performed autopsy on the Arab world in the pages of <!-- copied at 1 --><i >Foreign Affairs</i> called <!-- copied at 1 --><i >Rethinking the Middle East</i>. In it, he declared that Gulf War I was the end of pan-Arabism. Arabs are finally going to have to wake up and decide that they have unique interests (what about the monolithic civilization?). But what could attract them in the absence of pan-Arabism? Islamic fundamentalism. And that could go hand in hand with, what Lewis called, "Lebanonization" whereby Middle East states will collapse "into a chaos of squabbling, feuding, fighting sects, tribes, regions and parties." [aside: Ever wonder why The Chosen One says "freedom" all the time? In this piece Lewis tells us that the word "freedom" is a good word in Arab history synonymous with independence but the word "democracy" is a bad word synonymous with sham parliamentary regimes]. The only way out, Lewis wrote, is to do as the Turks did (Turks are not Arabs, he wisely pointed out) and embrace democracy. But, the way to spread the democracy is through regional security alliances and staunch support of Israel. 



But Saddam Hussein had survived. How can the Arabs have democracy if Saddam is there? The obsession of neo-cons with Iraq and remaking the Middle East is well documented elsewhere (and on CM) and the man who provided them insights into the Arab mind was always Bernard Lewis. In 1998, Lewis was one of the signatories of a <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/index.jsp?section=papers&amp;code=01-D_76">letter</a> asking President Clinton to invade Iraq and install a provisional government there.

I projected that Iran will be next in the crosshairs. If you remember a few months ago (in Aug/Sep), there was some talk of al-Qaeda <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=322747">regrouping</a> in Iran and that Iranians were sending massive aid to insurgents in Baghdad and were even <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=322747">hosting</a> al-Qaeda [forget the whole rabid anti-Shi'ism professed by UBL].

Like the INC before the war, the MEK has advocates in the highest levels of government. And like the INC, the MEK has been inundating the U.S. intelligence community with uncorroborated and, according to some intelligence officials, highly suspect information meant to encourage the White House to carry out the same policy of regime change in Iran that it did in Iraq.

It is permitting and encouraging activities that are killing not just our Iraqi friends but also, and quite directly, American troops. So we have a real Syria problem.
Of course we also have--the world also has--an Iran problem, and a Saudi problem, and lots of other problems. The Iran and Saudi problems may ultimately be more serious than the Syria problem. But the Syria problem is urgent: It is Bashar Assad's regime that seems to be doing more than any other, right now, to help Baathists and terrorists kill Americans in the central front of the war on terror. [...]We could bomb Syrian military facilities; we could go across the border in force to stop infiltration; we could occupy the town of Abu Kamal in eastern Syria, a few miles from the border, which seems to be the planning and organizing center for Syrian activities in Iraq <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="anthologize-image-wrapper"><img src="endquote.gif"/></div></div>

Here comes 2005.</div></div><div class="library-item"><h3 class="library-item-title">Coronation</h3><div class="library-item-content"><div class="anthologize-image-wrapper"><img src="coronation.jpg" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="6"/></div>Many friends have forwarded emails asking not to spend a dime today or turn my back or stand upside my head. Lot of hoopla over the $40 million tag, lot about the corporation money flowing into the ceremonies, lot on the lameness of the celebrities. Here on campus, there are elaborate counter-Inauguration talks and happening. At first, I admit to being befuddled. What matters? He got elected. THAT was the crucial part. This is just a ritual. Why is everyone so worked up about this? Why are the Repubs spending so much money? Why the lunatic left send me mass emails? Come on, people, it's just Inauguration Day! 

Then I got to thinking about why people would be worked up over this. The Inauguration Day is an essential ritual of this, or any, republic. The pomp and circumstance is designed to construct the very mythology of consensus among the people. The ritual is structured by populism so that we, the people, can identify with the political regime. It gives the necessary means to unify the electorate after a contentious election. It grants the president-elect the symbolic power to rule. Its forebearer, the coronation, similarly granted the divine power to rule.

Since I am currently re-reading Kantorowicz's <!-- copied at 1 --><i >King's Two Bodies</i>, I sought the description of the <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://inaugural.senate.gov/history/daysevents/index.htm">ceremonies</a> of the day and thought it would be amusing for all of you to compare them to some other reginal coronations.

The ancient to medieval Hindu kingship rituals were collectively referred to as <!-- copied at 1 --><i >raja-karma</i> [royal rituals]. The ceremony had to be held on the proper day and time with respect to the kings heavenly charts and the stars etc. Before the actual day of the ceremony, an elaborate ritual of purification and pacification of evil spirits etc. was performed at the site.

The king, who must have fasted and abstained from sexual intercourse the night before shows up in brand new clothes at the break of dawn and looks for omens in the morning sky. After that the ceremony starts [note that throughout the ceremonies, there is constant recitation of various mantras]:
<!-- copied at 1 --><ul ><!-- copied at 1 --><li>The king goes to a small hutch and sits on an ordinary bench. The priests purifies fifteen parts of the king's body with clay from the appropriate parts of the earth's surface [for example, head with clay from top of mountain, heart with clay from the royal palace, stomach with clay from where two rivers meet, loins with clay from a courtesan's doorway]
</li><!-- copied at 1 --><li>After this the king is bathed from a golden jar to which five products of the cow have been added.
</li><!-- copied at 1 --><li>Next, he is bathed in clear water. 
</li><!-- copied at 1 --><li>The king is then seated on a throne made from a fig tree and gilded with copper and gold. Four Brahmanas take up positions at the four corners. Over the king's head, one pours butter out of a golden pot, one pours  sweetened milk out of a silver pot, one pours thickened milk out of a copper pot and the last ones baptizes the king's feet with water from a clay pot. 
</li><!-- copied at 1 --><li>The king is then dressed in dry clothes and sat on his throne. He touches the royal bow and arrow, circumabulates the fire, and bows to his elders. He then gets on the royal horse and leaves to walls of the palace to visit his city and temples. 
</li><!-- copied at 1 --><li>The king takes on the Royal crown at his return<!-- copied at 1 --><sup>1</sup>.
</li></ul>

Within the medieval European context, the coronation is also the site where heavenly power transfers into the earthly vessel and the king becomes an instrument of god's will. For example, here is the Tudor ceremony:
<!-- copied at 1 --><ul ><!-- copied at 1 --><li>The king enters Westminster Abbey and is recognized by the people.
</li><!-- copied at 1 --><li>The king is led to the high altar where he makes an offering of a pall and a pound of gold.
</li><!-- copied at 1 --><li>A sermon is preached by a bishop.
</li><!-- copied at 1 --><li>The archbishop administers the oath.
</li><!-- copied at 1 --><li>The king lies prostrate before the altar while prayers are said over him.
</li><!-- copied at 1 --><li>The king is anointed.
</li><!-- copied at 1 --><li>The archbishop blesses the ornaments and insignia one by one, and the king is invested with them in turn. They consist of the long tunic, buskins, sandals, spurs, girdle, sword, armils, mantle, crown, ring, gloves, sceptre, and rod.
</li><!-- copied at 1 --><li>The king is led to his throne and homage is paid.
</li><!-- copied at 1 --><li>The mass is celebrated.
</li><!-- copied at 1 --><li>The king is taken to St. Edwards divested of his robes and ornaments and revested with others<!-- copied at 1 --><sup>2</sup></li></ul> 

Among the Nigerian Umundri, the coronation ceremony transforms the man into a king with divine powers. He is chosen from among the royal families by the ancestral spirits (a dry wall of his compound falls for no discernable reason). He has to be an orphan. The ceremony opens with the ritual of death. This account was observed in the early 20th century.
<!-- copied at 1 --><ul ><!-- copied at 1 --><li>The king is lowered into a grave. A plank is thrown across and dirt over him. He remains buried for some hours
</li><!-- copied at 1 --><li>He is taken out at sunset and washed in the river. His body, including the hair of his head, is whitened with clay and water. His wife undergoes similar treatment.
</li><!-- copied at 1 --><li>He discards all clothes and may only wear white or blue from now on.
</li><!-- copied at 1 --><li>Next, the king, his wife and an entourage begin the clockwise circumabulation of his land.
</li><!-- copied at 1 --><li>In various towns, he sits on a throne and eats white clay.
</li><!-- copied at 1 --><li>He ends the journey in his new capital where the new palace is built. He never leaves the capital.<!-- copied at 1 --><sup>3</sup>.
</li></ul>

There are many ways to read this development. The first, and most obvious, reading is that this is a deliberate road-block thrown to subvert the pre-ordained beatification of <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/02/26/news/newsmakers/bc.people.bono.reut/?cnn=yes">Bono</a>. The White House had to have been worried sick about the true heart of Bono forgiving all loans to Africa or something. In Wolfowitz, they have found someone who won't just raise the interest rate but <!-- copied at 1 --><i >invade</i> Africa to collect from World-Bank-loan-defaultin'-Mercedes-driving-Warrior-Kings. 

The second, more nuanced, reading is that the Bush Doctrine is undergoing metamorphosis. From a hungry, hungry caterpillar of war to a sweet, little butterfly of democracy. The softening on Iran and the carrot/stick on Syria could presumably be seen as signs of non-aggression. We all know that Wolfowitz wanted Syria and Iran. If those invasions were still on the table, there is no way that Wolfowitz, the intellectual commander, could leave. But why? Well. About three weeks after the second inauguration, every President hears the word <!-- copied at 1 --><i >Legacy</i>. Bushies, working on their own beatification project, are looking at a monotonous insurgency in Iraq, trillionish deficits and a Social Security Reform that is as popular with comedians as Clinton's Health Care Reform. So how does The Chosen One cement a lasting Rooseveltian legacy? Have freedom march across Middle East, yo. Go all tough diplomacy. James Bolton to UN; Basmati to State; and pack Wolfowitz off to glitzy dinners. 

But, I can't even begin to do a real analysis. Y'all should go see <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://cheznadezhda.blogharbor.com/blog/praktikesplace">Praktike</a> or <!-- copied at 1 --><a  href="http://modeforcaleb.blogspot.com/2005/03/burke-on-wolfowitz-and-war.html">Caleb</a>.
