    a gay desi?

    "deciding to come to Chicago for his Ph.D."



    Man, I was way more drunk than I thought...



    Incidentally, two stops after we parted my bus broke down and I had to stand half in the storm, half in the doorway, waiting for a replacement. At least London smiles on visitors!



    As for more crowded... <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=973" rel="nofollow">yup</a>.

    eh, pity about the timing, i'd have given you a tour (not of cambridge, but the Other Place) had it been a month-ish earlier or later.  Also, if yr Body Shop forays were unfruitful, tell your unruly-haired friends to try ebay--it's been a reliable source of the indian gardenia perfume since TPTB at body ship discontinued it.



    did you buy lots of books in London?

    sin: my bad, i woulda loved to hang with you. next time around.



    rob: you were not that drunk. you just made the wise choice. perhaps not in the matter of transportation.



    e: i would have loved a tour of the Other Place - where I may be headed in May.

    Sadly, this is the first time that I never bought any printed material on a trip - not even a newspaper. I have little explanation. I did spend a bunch of time in a few bookstores. But, somehow, I am perennially distracted lately.

<p>So the week flew by and I have done no shopping. Trudged around Oxford Street looking for something. Went to a couple of Body Shops - ahem - and found nothing. Is it just me or is London a tad more crowded now [then, say 1766 when I was last here - sheesh]. My quest to find a cricket vest - not so lucky.</p>
<p>The highlight, as always, has been in meeting people. I had a great night out on Wed.&Acirc;&not;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;with <a href="http://rob.ifanything.org/other/">Rob</a>, Spencer and dacoit [congrats to Rob for finishing his M.A. and deciding to come to Chicago for his Ph.D.] Also, saw Raphael, a former student who is now reporting for the A.P&Acirc;&not;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;in London. He told me about the nutty statement of&Acirc;&not;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;Ze Pope - as it had just come&Acirc;&not;&acirc;&euro;&nbsp;out that morning. I remember contemplating that the reaction to such statements could be ugly. Then, I emerged from the 2 day occulsion at the conference to find out the reaction, indeed, has been ugh-lee. Oh well. At least, at Cambridge were more grand hangouts with Africanists and other scholars of the colonial ilk.</p>
<p>Pictures and more as I gather my senses - after I get back to Chicago.</p>
