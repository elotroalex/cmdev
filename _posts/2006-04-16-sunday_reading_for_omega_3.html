<p><img class="graphic" src="/images/sunday.jpg"/>What is it about Sunday afternoons? I sit here, watching an infomercial about Iceland health omega 3 which cures cancer, poverty and inflation. Just before that I was watching Chitrahar with New York Life and CitiBank commercials galore for NRIs everywhere. Oh good, Mythbusters is on. </p>
<p>We were gonna play some cricket. But, it rained. And rained. Pushing lilacs out of the dead land. </p>

<li><i>NYT</i> explains that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/magazine/16wwln_idealab.html?ex=1302840000&amp;en=42040a1da92a9fe6&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">this Omega 3 thing</a> is somekind of a zeitgeist moment that I have tapped into this Sunday.

<li><i>LRB</i> has a wonderful review essay on <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n08/mant01_.html"> Robespierre</a> by Hilary Mantel and on the <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n08/birc01_.html">Land of Pure Delights</a> by Dinah Birch.

<li>Iqbal Ahmed <a href="http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/books/reviews/article358104.ece">travelled</a> across Great Britain looking for clich&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&copy;s.
</li>
<li>In the <i>WaPo</i>, Azar Nafisi has reading <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/14/AR2006041401895_pf.html">tips</a> to get to know the country we bomb next while Anthony Shadid goes home to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/14/AR2006041401910.html">Lebanon</a>.
</li>
<li>Finally in the <i>NYT</i> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/magazine/16goytisolo.html?ex=1302840000&amp;en=91adfd89f123e675&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">Goytisolo - the anti-Orientalist</a>. </li>
