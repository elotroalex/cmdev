<p>Rohit points to this absurd "Roots of Indian Muslim Rage" <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1862650,00.html">piece</a> (Jets v Sharks!). Suketu Mehta has the "here is why they hate our freedoms" <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/29/opinion/29mehta.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">piece</a>. </p>
<p>I am waiting to hear from our enlightened commentators about the Versace connection between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cunanan">Cunanan</a> and the Bombay raiders. What is in that brand that drives young men to madness? Well?</p>
<p>I will put up something more helpful in the next few days - maybe a reading list on the "indian muslim thing".</p>
<p>Things will be ok. I have to believe that. I have to hope. Now more than ever.</p>
