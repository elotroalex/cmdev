  content: I COMPLETELY agree that the new year should beging either on the Winter
    Solsitice or the Vernal Equinox. Those days mean something. Unlike the 1st of
    January.

    Hi: I enjoy reading your posts: but shouldn't it be bated breath, rather than baited breath. Correct me if I am wrong:
    ref: Still, I have been waiting with baited breath for April to arrive.

<p>Happy New Year [i know that was mar 21]. Yes, I am one of the fools who think that Spring should begin the new year and not the dead of winter. If the calendar goes outta whack 11.5 minutes every year...well, that is how long I waste on this blog every hour anyways. All my holydays are pagan ones: Halloween, Vernal Equinox, May Day, Fourth of July. </p>
<p>This one year, the daily <i>Jang</i> in Lahore published news that the tigers had escaped from the zoo. Mass panic. My mom wanted us to go to the roof until I pointed out that tigers can climb walls and trees. She wanted us in the kitchen, after that [there is food to distract him]. After the cries "april's fool" were heard, the mullahs went into full effect decrying the festival as the worst evil Islamic civilization had ever faced. That was my fav. prank. </p>
<p>Still, I have been waiting with baited breath for April to arrive. One, I was sick and tired of March. Damn month had an attitude. Second, no more papers to deliver for the rest of the year. Third, this is CMs birthday month and some significant changes are in store for the lil-blog-that-can't-anymore.</p>
<p>Gentle readers, I started CM, last year, for a year. That year comes to its close in a week. CM will shut down in a week. Sepoy will be set to pasture. Lest you think this is a cruel joke for the cruelest month, I impress upon you my sincerity. </p>
<p>But, fear not. The tigers won't get you. CM 2.0 will be here.</p>
