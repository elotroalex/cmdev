<p>Looks like I may not return from my trip home. <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/060523/cgtu006.html?.v=52">Wireless WiMAX over all of Pakistan!</a> Couple this with the news that the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pete/152018285/in/set-72057594143224765/">first prototype</a> of the <a href="http://www.laptop.org/">$100 laptop</a> is out, and we are talking about something, big. Raincheck: People still have to pay. And we all know what the %age of paying customers is in homistans....</p>
