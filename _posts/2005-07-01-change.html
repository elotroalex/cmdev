<p>Abdul Walid, who changed elck, is now taking himself <a href="http://vernacularbody.typepad.com/vernacularbody/2005/06/last_bird_out.html">away</a> from blogistan. It is an understatement that he will be missed.</p>
<p>Cricket has decided to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/4633311.stm">introduce</a> changes. One can send in a substitute batsman or bowler. Why do I still have the paranoia that I am the one who will get sub'd? </p>
<p>SDO has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/07/01/resignation.supreme/index.html">left</a> the SCOTUS. Eh.</p>
<p>I must change. CM must change. We must all change or we die. <i>show me the way to the next whiskey bar</i>.</p>
