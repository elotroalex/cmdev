<p>Naim Sahib has a must-read review, in <i>Outlook India</i> of LeT's propagandistic <i>Ham Ma'ien Lashkar-e-Taiba Ki</i>, <a href="http://www.outlookindia.com/fullprint.asp?choice=1&fodname=20081215&fname=naim&sid=1">The Mothers Of The Lashkar</a>. I will leave you to read the essay in full, but apropos of my <a href="/archives/homistan/the_third_migration.html">earlier post</a>, this stood out:</p>
<blockquote><p>To my knowledge there is no companion book about the fathers. In fact, in a great many narratives included in the book the fathers are mainly absent. Often literally so, toiling somewhere in the Middle East, providing nothing more than financial support to their families. The absence of the fathers probably helps the Lashkar in their recruiting efforts. </p></blockquote>
