  content: How did you find that interview? It didn't quite live up to the promise,
    I felt. Not quite sure <i>why</i> though... Maybe I was just left wondering what
    Kureishi had brought to the interview that anybody else couldn't have?

  content: it was highlighted on Guardian's book page, I think. I think that one thing
    hanif did bring to the interview was to give a sense of the differences in their
    immigrant upbringings.
