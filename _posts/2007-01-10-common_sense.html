  content: It would be a tough job to translate this pamphlet into Urdu. Since most
    Urdu readers are not aware of the background, it will be good if you write a preface
    to the translation with lots of end notes for further explainations.

<p>On January 10, 1776, Thomas Paine published, anonymously, his pamphlet, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Sense_(pamphlet)">Common Sense</a>. I actually didn't remember this but Washington Post's very helpful <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/09/AR2007010901299.html">Today in History</a> reminded me. </p>
<p>Which also reminded me that sometimes in July, 2006, I had decided to annotate and translate <i>Common Sense</i> into Urdu. I admit that the only progress I made on this so far is to get the title translated - trust me, it was far harder than you'd imagine. I also read through Paine's <i>Rights of Man</i> and <i>The Age of Reason</i>. </p>
<p>I honestly don't know if I can do this judiciously - or at all. But, with  2008 being the year when Pakistan's resident dictator decides, again, to suspend democracy and freedom - with the help of the White House - I think it will be my fruitless gesture.</p>
