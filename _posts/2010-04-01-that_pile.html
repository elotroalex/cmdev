  content: "Sepoy, I haven't read it, but I have heard that \"Cities of Salt\" is
    one of the most important novels of all time. It actually forms the first part
    of a trilogy, about how the find of oil changes the lives of people in an arabian
    village (not really for the better, you can imagine). Angry Arab mentioned once
    that every student in the arab world would read the work in the future.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I'm surprised to see nothing by Naguib Mafouz. I hear his modern cairo trilgoy
    is specacular.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I have read some of, and that I really recommend
    is \"Modern Arabic Fiction: An Anthology\" http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Arabic-Fiction-Salma-Jayyusi/dp/0231132557/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1270146156&amp;sr=8-2\r\n\r\nIt's
    a great buy, over 1000 pages, edited by  Salma Jayyusi. It features short stories
    and novel exerts. She's also done anthologies on modern arabic poetry, m arabic
    drama, palestinian lit, saudi lit, and arabian (anything from saudi borders to
    yemen) lit.\r\n\r\nA review: \"Who is this incredible woman who has managed to
    do what has eluded entire institutions... another magnum opus.\" -- Ferial J.
    Ghazoul, Al-Ahram Weekly"

    Zahra by Hanan al-Shaykh? Re Mahfouz....sepoy just doesn't go for the fetish for
    large, gelatinously fleshed ladies, I bet. My fave Mahfouz is Miramar. Quite different
    from the others.

  content: "Season of Migration to the North - blows all your stereotypes of the Sudan
    away.  \r\n\r\nCities of Salt was Meh.  I get the idea that no one is a hero,
    but a thousand pages of it gets tiresome.  Plus, they didn't even bother to translate
    the final two books (it's a five-part series in Arabic, but apparently they figured
    that English readers wouldn't be able to keep focus that long).   Hard for me
    to say that, as I actually met Munif once and liked him a lot.  I think his best
    work is one that is not translated - Sharq al-Mutawassit (East of the Mediterranean),
    a tight, gripping story in Arabic about a political prisoner in an unnamed Arab
    country.\r\n\r\nIf you think that your collection is too Egypt-centric, then you
    really should check out  Ghassan Kanafani, the legendary Palestinian author assassinated
    by the Israelis in the 70's.  He writes beautifully about Palestinian culture
    and life.  You would probably like the collection of short stories that includes
    his best known, \"Men in the Sun,\" which sets the table for the rise of Palestinian
    resistance."

  content: I haven't read (or had even heard of) most of the non-Mahfouz books mentioned
    in this thread, so apart from being embarrassed, the Jayyusi anthology is a good
    place to begin for me (thanks Nikolai).  I have heard a lot about Cities of Salt,
    although I recall Fouad Ajami not thinking too highly of it (in "The Dream Palace
    of the Arabs", from back in the day when I read Ajami, before he sold out to the
    "they will respect us if we whack 'em" crowd).

  content: "that's what i get for knowing no arabic, forgeting that cities of salt
    isn't a trilogy. still havent read it but, as sepoy said, 'it's on the proverbial
    pile'\r\n\r\ni hope you enjoy ms jayyusi's anthology qalandar. even my mom started
    to read some of it.\r\n\r\nPS - there's another important anthology, and i don't
    like how some of it is structured, but it is certainly servicable and the best
    we have. \r\n\r\nNight and Horses and the Desert: An Anthology of Classical Arabic
    Literature\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Night-Horses-Desert-Anthology-Literature/dp/0385721552/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1270265492&amp;sr=8-1#noop\r\n\r\nit's
    everything before the modern period, though the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries
    are not well served (though honestly this is not because of the editor, but because
    of both a lack of awarness in western scholarship about arabic lit in the period
    and because, from my understanding, the concesus among arab scholars is that this
    period is one of stark decline in arabic lit (though i think that this opinion
    will change slightly when people appreciate classical arabic popular fiction more
    - maybe, just a layman's opinion!))"

  content: Kanafani is a must, and people keep recommending Sahar Khalifeh's "Wild
    Thorns" to me as well.  And if you are not insistent on sticking to fiction, Mourid
    Barghouti's "I Saw Ramallah" (translated by Soueif) is one of my favorite books
    from anywhere.  "The Anchor Book of Modern Arabic Fiction" is a good anthology,
    and the good people at Saqi (http://www.saqibooks.com/) are publishing all kinds
    of marvels I've only begun to explore.  They have a bookshop in London, if you
    want to make a pilgrimage during your trip to the UK.

  content: "This is a bit long, but here goes:\r\n\r\nHere's a list of Arabic lit
    blogs that I've found useful.\r\nhttp://arablit.wordpress.com/ - the most important
    one\r\nhttp://readkutub.wordpress.com/\r\nhttp://yrakha.wordpress.com/\r\nhttp://quarterlyconversation.com/constant/
    - not so much the blog as the reviews\r\nhttp://www.banipal.co.uk/\r\nhttp://beirut39.blogspot.com/\r\nhttp://www.al-bab.com/blog/blog1003b.htm
    \ - march 24 2010\r\n\r\nAlso, here's a series that's just started on the Arab
    Writers' Union's top 100 Arabic language books: http://arablit.wordpress.com/2010/04/23/the-best-100-arabic-books-according-to-the-arab-writers-union-1-10/
    - this is fantastic.\r\n\r\nI'm studying advanced Arabic and I've read good chunks
    of three books and alot of short stories, but I've been looking for books to read
    on my own or with my Arab friends.  I tried reading Palace Walk in Arabic with
    the English version as a crutch, but the translation is terribly inexact.  Humphrey
    Davies, who translated The Yacoubian Building, did a fantastic job (I've closely
    read about a quarter of the book in Arabic so far) - the text is really close
    to the original.  So I've been looking at other books he's done.    Here's an
    interview with him: http://quarterlyconversation.com/the-humphrey-davies-interview\r\n\r\n
    Denys Johnson-Davies is another good translator, and although I don't know much
    his work, he's the most respected in the field and was something of a pioneer,
    and every book published by the New York Review of Books Press is AWESOME, so:\r\n
    \   -->http://www.amazon.com/Season-Migration-North-Review-Classics/dp/1590173023/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpi_1\r\n\r\n
    \   Anyways, here's Humphrey Davies translations that I'm considering\r\n\r\n
    http://www.amazon.com/Gate-Sun-Elias-Khoury/dp/0312426704/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1272045720&amp;sr=1-1\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Being-Abbas-Abd-Ahmed-Alaidy/dp/9774160045/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1272049526&amp;sr=1-6\r\n\r\nAlso,
    about Ahlam Mosteghanemi - Davies translated her second book, Chaos of the Senses,
    although Memory of the Flesh, her first, is more highly regarded and won a major
    literary prize.  It is claimed that she is something like first major female Algerian
    literary figure to write in Arabic. \r\n http://www.amazon.com/Memory-Flesh-Modern-Arabic-Writing/dp/9774247345/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_b\r\n
    http://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Senses-Modern-Arabic-Literature/dp/9774160983/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1272051300&amp;sr=8-1\r\n\r\nThis
    next book isn't Davies, but I've heard that this book is FANTASTIC and is also
    a short read.  Someone else recommended it in the comments.\r\n    http://www.amazon.com/Men-Sun-Other-Palestinian-Stories/dp/0894108573/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1272045681&amp;sr=1-11\r\n\r\n
    Cities of Salt looks cool, but exceedingly daunting in Arabic. \r\n http://www.amazon.com/Cities-Salt-Abdelrahman-Munif/dp/039475526X/ref=pd_sim_b_2\r\n\r\n
    \   I kind of want to read this too in English when I get the chance - I'm a sucker
    for North Critical Editions and think that it's a fabulous idea for 1001 Nights
    because it has had such an influential effect on Western culture.\r\n\r\n    http://www.amazon.com/Arabian-Nights-Norton-Critical-Editions/dp/039392808X/ref=pd_sim_b_3\r\n
    \   http://www.amazon.com/Arabian-Nights-II-Sindbad-Popular/dp/0393315177/ref=pd_sim_b_3\r\n\r\n
    \   This might be cool, too.  \r\n    http://www.amazon.com/Distant-Minaret-Stories-African-Writers/dp/0435909126/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpi_4"

<p>Recently, I have started reading again. Just finished Hans Fallada, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Alone-Berlin-Penguin-Hardback-Classics/dp/184614082X">Alone in Berlin</a> - which was profoundly sad and completely human. An email prompted me to make a shortlist of books I would like to tackle next. The following list is of Arabic (largely Egypt-centric) literature in translation. Some I read a while back and would like to re-visit. Others are on that proverbial pile.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Other-Place-Ibrahim-Abdel-Meguid/dp/9774249585">The Other Place</a>, Ibrahim Abdel Meguid. It was between this and his <em>No One Sleeps in Alexandria</em> but the Gulf remains the weirdest place on Earth, and this novel jibes most with my memories there. Such as they were.
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eye-Sun-Ahdaf-Soueif/dp/0385720378/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1270114577&sr=1-1-spell">In the Eye of the Sun</a>, Ahdaf Soueif. This be a classic in every sense of the word. I haven't read it in a long while, but I remember awe.
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Yusuf-Idris-Masterpieces-Egyptian/dp/9774162420/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1270114676&sr=1-1">The Essential Yusuf Idris</a>, Yusuf Idris.
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Season-Migration-North-African-Writers/dp/0435900668">Season of Migration to the North</a>, Tayeb Salih.
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gate-Sun-Elias-Khoury/dp/0312426704/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1270114836&sr=1-2">Gate of the Sun</a>, Elias Khoury.
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sunset-Oasis-Bahaa-Taher/dp/0771083866/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1270114856&sr=1-2">Sunset Oasis</a>, Bahaa Taher.
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lamp-Umm-Hashim-Other-Stories/dp/9774247884/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1270115084&sr=1-5">The Lamp of Umm Hashmi and Other Stories</a>, Yahya Haqqi. One of my favorites.
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gold-Dust-Modern-Arabic-Literature/dp/9774161432/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1270115129&sr=1-1">Gold Dust</a>, Ibrahim al-Koni.
</ul>
