<p>Heading home is always a highlight and soon enough, I will be in sweet Hyde Park drowning in snow, slush, Powell's and Istria. Life will be as it ought to be. As it once was.</p>
<p>However, before that, I am participating in - it readily appears - a wonderful conference at the University of Pennsylvania. I am going to try and lay out (what will be a chapter eventually) my understanding of the position prophecy holds in the imaginations of middle-class Pakistanis. I will also talk about Zaid Hamid. </p>
