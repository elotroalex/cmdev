<p>Yesterday I come home and there are two letters waiting for me. One from University of Liverpool politely declining the interest i had expressed in them. The other from the College saying I didn't get a teaching fellowship I had applied for.<br />
A little disappointed. Just had such a great run lately, with the awards and the support etc.<br />
Back to the grind. Who wants Liverpool anyways??</p>
