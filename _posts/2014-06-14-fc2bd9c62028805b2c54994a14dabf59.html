<p>So all of the violence in India is only committed by elite Hindus, you are saying that Muslims do not commit violence, Christians are saints and minorities just live peacefully. I was brought up Hindu but have not believed in god for over 2 decades, best decision I have ever made. The problem is with intellectuals like the author, to them all Ills in India are due to Hindus, not the Muslims, Christians, Sikhs or minorities. Only if India was a Muslim country like Pakistan or Bangladesh, Hindus would be a quickly diminishing minority and all violence would end. All parties are to blame for violence, the elites for their corruption of the state by money and power, the poor and minorities for allowing liberals and intellectuals to use them as a mindless vote bank and not enforcing their power by numbers and the government for passing laws but not enforcing them and allowing NGOs to fill the void like vultures.<br />
