<p>CM friend Baraka thinks that there is a stereotype about Muslim women out there that does not show them as the thinking, feeling, lively people with loving hearts and independent minds that we know them to be. And she is doing something about it by calling for real-life stories about Muslim women in relationships/dating being told by Muslim women themselves. Please <a href="http://rickshawdiaries.wordpress.com/2008/01/08/reminder-literary-anthology-deadline/">send your stories</a> to her.</p>
