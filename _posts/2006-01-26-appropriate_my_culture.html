<p>Remember <a href="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=22&ItemID=6129">Norma Khouri</a>? Another <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/index.php?option=com_lawcontent&task=view&id=12468&Itemid=47">hoaxer</a> exposed. This one became Navajo. And got the first break by screeding that Native Americans don't get published...Incidentally, I didn't know that <i>Education of Little Tree</i> was written by a klansman!  </p>
