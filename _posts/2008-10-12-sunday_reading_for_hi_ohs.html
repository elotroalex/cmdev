<p><img src="/images/sunday.jpg" alt="" />I will have some pictures up tomorrow of Ohio, including the fivethirtyeight.com road crew <i>in situ</i>, on the road. I can report that nearly every single ad I have seen on tv from McCain has been a negative ad - including some delectably served hate from NRA (check out gunbanobama.com, if you must). And everything I saw from Obama has been on the issue. Weird, no? And yet, Cookie Roberts can fold her hands and sanctimoniously declare that both sides have been negative. I hate pun-dits. </p>
<ul>
<li>India's <a href="http://www.animationxpress.com/anex/y2k8/headlines/anex2835.htm">Arjun</a> is what happens when Aladdin grows up (in animation terms). Here is a <a href="http://www.brightcove.tv/title.jsp?title=1848947024">preview</a>.
<li>Tariq Ali's newest gets <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/oct/11/tariq-ali">reviewed</a> by Muhammad Hanif. He likes it.
<li>Nadeem Aslam's latest, <i>The Wasted Vigil</i>, is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/books/review/Adams-t.html?partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">reviewed</a> by Lorraine Adams. A lot of people liked his earlier novel, but I couldn't get into his prose. Doesn't look-it that it has improved an awful lot.
<li>Chetan Bhagat is the John Grisham of India. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/09/india">Or something</a>.
<li>Zizek's <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v00/n03/zize01_.html">political economy</a> needs wider reading.
<li>The novel on Aisha is reportedly <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/mohammad-wife-novel-released-early-in-us-953814.html">published</a>.
<li>Lastly, History <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/news/historical_archives_a_most_drunken">done right</a>.
</ul>
