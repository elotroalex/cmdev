<p><a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com"><img src="/img/moore.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6></a>Michael Moore's <a href="http://www.festival-cannes.fr/films/fiche_film.php?langue=6002&id_film=4201423">Farenheit 9/11</a> will unleash a hounds-of-hell worthy controversy as it nears its US release. I thought <em>Bowling for Columbine </em> was effective in highlighting the culture of fear. This movie, based largely on the research of <a href="http://www.houseofbush.com/index.php">Craig Unger</a>, looks to highlight the relationship between Bush and BinLaden. Do you remember this Boondock from 11/22/2001?</p>

<p>Roger Ebert has posted from Cannes <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/eb-feature/cst-ftr-cannes18.html">his reaction </a> to the screening. I highlight the passage about UChicago's own Wolfie:</p>
<div class=quote><img src="/img/startquote.gif">After the first press screening on Monday, journalists noted on their way out that Moore was more serious in this film and took fewer cheap shots. But there are a few. Wait until you see Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz preparing for a TV interview. First he puts a pocket comb in his mouth to wet it and combs down his hair. Still not satisfied, he spits on his hand and wipes the hair into place. Catching politicians being made up for TV is an old game, but this is a first. <img src="/img/endquote.gif"></div>
<p>and <a href="http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=17587"> more reactions. </a><br />
<b>update</b>: Farenheit 9/11 <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/22/cannes.finale.ap/index.html">wins the Palme d'Or</a>.</p>
