  content: oddly enough, though i hadn't since about may, have been listening to the
    above mentioned again. nothing like their fine line between bejewelled/sweet and
    harmonically scattering to the four winds to accompany (loudly, so as to keep
    the turbofolk out) the prevailing "glum in Serbia" outlook....

<p>Saw <a href="http://www.arcadefire.com/">Arcade Fire</a> at the Riviera last night with <a href="http://www.iseemonsters.com">sven</a> and rajeev. What an amazing show - def. one for my best of list. They play like maniacs and behave like ones too - rocking out in their band gear. So darn cute. </p>
<p>I must admit that after keeping them in heavy rotation for most of nov thru feb period, I had stopped listening to them. Also, the orchestrations were starting to sound a tad precious [same thing happened to me w/ regards to Decemberists except it was Colin's voice in that case]. So, while I wanted to see them, I wasn't as excited as I could have been. Holy Smoke! they rocked my doubts away. </p>
<p>If the Arcade Fire come anywhere near your neck of the woods, GO SEE THEM.</p>
<p><b>updated:</b> An actual <a href="http://avclub.com/content/node/41204">review of the show</a> from the Onion's blog.</p>
