    And rob the mystery from the chapati? how about the short version: I played lots of cricket in Lahore and Pindi from '86 to '91. Long version: let's wait for when nostalgia strikes. A Pakistan win over England would be a trigger, I predict.
    Also, that first name, <a href="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/player/caps.html?country=7;class=1" rel="nofollow">Emir Elahi</a> is where I got my cricketing genes from.
