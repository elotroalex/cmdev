<p><img src="/img/blogiversary.jpg"/>On this second blogiversary, I would like to thank all of you gentle readers ((I especially want to thank the healthy 28-35% of traffic from .mil and .gov domains.)). Amazingly, since day one, I never felt that my audience was fictive ((see Walter Ong's <i>The Writer's Audience is Always Fiction</i>)). But that may be because I have never considered myself an author. This blog has been many things but, more than anything else, it has been a place for me to carry on a global chai-chat. As my time frees up, over this coming summer, I plan on doing more with this soapbox. For one, the election are coming. So expect the activist to return. And then, Iran is back in the cross-hairs. And, hey, at least my pretension of being an 'area-expert' are more credible in that theater. </p>
<p>So, stick around, and we shall fill a few more databases with our collective words.</p>
