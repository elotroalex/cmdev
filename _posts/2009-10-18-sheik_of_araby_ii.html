<p><i><br />
Silently through the night to the sultan's tent where he<br />
would secretly meet up with Fatima of the Seven Veils,<br />
swingingest grade "A" number one US choice dancer in<br />
the sultan's whole harem, 'cause, heh, him and her had<br />
a thing goin', you know, and they'd been carryin' on<br />
for some time now behind the sultan's back and you<br />
could hear him talk to his camel as he rode out across the<br />
dunes, his voice would cut through the still night desert<br />
air and he'd say (imitate Arabic speech and finish with "Sold! American)<br />
which is Arabic for, "Stop, Clyde!" and Clyde'd say, (imitate camel<br />
sound), which is camel for, "Ok"</i></p>

<p><i>I live on the West side, she lives on the East side of the street<br />
And though they say that East is East and West is West<br />
And never the twain shall meet<br />
Each morning I face her window and pray that our love can be<br />
'cause that brownstone house where my baby lives<br />
Is Mecca, Mecca to me </i></p>
