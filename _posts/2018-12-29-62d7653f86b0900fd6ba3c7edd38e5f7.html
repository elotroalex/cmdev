<p>This is about the Ten Questions series of interviews on the latest works on South Asian studies.  I am interested in conducting an interview with Dr. Milinda Banerjee, the author of the book The Mortal God: Imagining the Sovereign in Colonial India, which came out from Cambridge University Press in 2018.<br />
