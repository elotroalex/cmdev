<p>Hi Manan et al.,</p>
<p>I'm a graduate student at NYU in the History Dept. and my work is on agrarian financialization in South Asia. I'm writing now to say that I've really enjoyed recent interviews, especially of writers of first monographs in CM. I'd like to pitch a piece for that section of the blog: I'm proposing to interview Debjani Bhattacharya on her book "Empire and Ecology in the Bengal Delta: The Making of Calcutta" (http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/history/environmental-history/empire-and-ecology-bengal-delta-making-calcutta?format=HB#wwhE1PtK61Mb6uGg.97). I think her work speaks to urgent present concerns on urban ecologies as to a longer history of the making of modern South Asian urbanism.</p>
<p> I'm happy to write in greater detail, if you are at all interested. I blog for the Toynbee Prize Foundation occasionally, and my piece on Seema Alavi's "Muslim Cosmopolis" can be found here: http://toynbeeprize.org/interviews/seema-alavi/. </p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best,<br />
Meghna<br />
