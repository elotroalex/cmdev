    My wife and I are reading Pullman now, and the preliminary opinion is that His Dark Materials are fantastic.

    Next stop, Gaiman.

  content: "I only read His Dark Materials last year. A friend forced me to read the
    first book while I was in the middle of preparing for my orals. I DROVE to borders
    at 10:30 the same night to buy the second two volumes and I consumed them over
    the next days.\nSuch good stuff. \nYou will like Coraline as well. And I also
    recommend the Sandman series."

<p><img src="/images/coraline.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Some happy news on the movie front. I am a huge fan of Neil Gaiman - author of <i>Sandman</i> graphic novels. He is an amazing storyteller or myth-maker, as I like to call him. His 2002 children's-book-for-adults, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380807343/qid=1094847744/sr=8-1/ref=pd_cps_1/102-9739108-8520940?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Coraline</a>, is on top of the charts at the sepoy household having gone through innumerable readings. It is the story of a girl who walks through a door into a mirror image reality - if we consider the mirror to be slightly evil. Here is a <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/childrenandteens/0,6121,783536,00.html">review</a> of it by that "other" author of children's-book-for-adults Phillip Pullman.<br />
Anyways, the good news I wanted to share with me 4 readers was that it has been optioned as a <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/2004/09/film-news-and-stuff.asp">movie</a>. Normally that is not cause for celebration but, in this case, the movie will be made by Henry Selick doing a full stop-motion version. Brilliant, I say. Selick is the mastermind behind <i>Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas</i> - another great movie - whose latest work is in Wes Anderson's <i>Life Aquatic</i>. Movie heaven.</p>
