    Arrrgh! I forgot to answer the question below and it ate up my comment.

    Wanted to say that it was charming and eloquent and I enjoyed listening to it, but was disappointed by the somewhat schematic discussion of freedom, 1776 and 2001. Yes, we have to interrogate the foundational status of 1776, but we could also interrogate in the process, the imperial framework that places the British there and elsewhere at this time, and within which this so-called "moral moment" and "rough crossing" takes place. I was surprised to find no discussion of this larger context beyond individual cynicism and opportunism of officers, and of the genealogy he offers of magna carta and cromwell.



    But I think it was the description of that officer as "doltish good egg" that did it.
