  content: given the history of donations-for-relief in the sub-continent one feels
    doubly sorry for the victims. watch the parasites who grab the money faster than
    it comes in !

  content: While Edhi Foundation doesn't have any online donation page (or even web
    presence), I have mailed a check to their New York office a few times. It's slow
    but it does work.

  content: It was sunday and all we could do was mobilize people to send their blankets,
    clothing and other non-perishable items to the relief camps. I hope to have an
    online transaction account in few hours with the help of team of IndusMart, would
    put up the link at my blog as well as email you guys. I just have to see where
    to submit the money ASAP so as to speed up the process. Your help to spread the
    word would be much needed.

<p><img class="graphic" src="/images/pakearth.jpg">30,000 dead is being reported on PTV. The Margala Towers <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4322614.stm">collapsed</a> in Islamabad. I have a lot of family in the area and, so far, reports are that they are ok. The hardest hit areas in Azad Kashmir, esp. <a href="http://www.apnamansehra.com/">Mansera</a>, are places where we spend a lot of time. </p>
<p>I feel as helpless and unable to cope as I did when the Tsunami hit or Katrina. </p>
<p>What we all have done and what we all can do is send money. </p>
<p>The problem is that Pakistani relief agencies don't have a good setup for this. </p>
<p>Edhi Foundation is my recommendation but sending money to them is not easy if you are outside of Pakistan.</p>
<p>There are local charities and families that I know that could also appreciate some direct aid. </p>
<p>I am going to set up a Paypal account. All money will be send directly to either Edhi or families. I will try and be as open and transparent about it as possible. </p>
<p>More as soon as Paypal verifies my information and I have a link.</p>
<p>I hope that all of you readers can donate. Red Cross International is always there.</p>
