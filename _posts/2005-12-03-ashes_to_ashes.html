<p><img src="/img/pakwin.jpg"/>There was England with six series wins in a row, including the little matter of the Ashes. There was Pakistan, with a new coach, without having won a test series in who knows how long. I certainly don't. In 12.1 overs after lunch, eight English wickets fell and they lost the match by an innings and 100 runs. And the series went to Pakistan, 2-0. </p>
<p>I knew Lahore would have a result. I just didn't think it was going to be so <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/4494370.stm">glorious</a>. </p>
<p>On the Pakistani side, it is wonderful to see bats working for a change. Inzi _averaged_ 107. He has suddenly become the elder statesman/captain. How did that happen? Where is the goofy kid? Mohammad Yusuf's double century was amazing. Kudos to him. Kaman Akmal was the surprise for me.</p>
<p>On the English side, someone please stop abusing Flintoff - he bowled 140 overs! While Giles and Udal gave up 80 and 90 on the average. That has to hurt. And next stop, India? Ouch.</p>
<p>All in all, great show. </p>
