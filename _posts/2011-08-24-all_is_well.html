<p>I have a more detailed review of Maleeha Lodhi's edited volume <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pakistan-Beyond-Crisis-Maleeha-Lodhi/dp/1849041350/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1314184350&sr=8-1">Pakistan: Beyond 'The Crisis State'</a> in Dawn's Books & Authors: <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2011/08/21/cover-story-all-is-well-or-is-it.html">All is Well... or is it?</a> I had briefly discussed it in my previous <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/books/pakistan-why-the-us-must-think-outside-the-military-box?pageCount=0">review essay</a>, but this is special care:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pakistan, as a subject of critical analysis, is ill-served when realities are ignored for the sake of policy. The need to resist a crude stereotype of &ldquo;failed state&rdquo; is clear and present but to go &ldquo;beyond the crisis state&rdquo;, we must also look seriously to history, to narratives other than the state or military and admit the harsh truths: The Pakistani military is just as fallible as its civilian regime, though the latter needs the explicit support of the population as a legitimate government. The state structure incorporates within it gross injustices towards the minorities &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; defined religiously, ethnically or culturally. Redressing these injustices &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; against the Ahmadis, the Christians, the Hindus, the Baloch, the Swatis &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; is just as vital to the nation-state as the need to prioritise health or education or commercial sectors. This volume is but a hampered beginning in this long process of a national soul-searching.</p></blockquote>
