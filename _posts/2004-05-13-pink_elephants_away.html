  content: "Oh don't worry. If you deserve one, they will hunt you down and decry
    it onto you. Kinda like a GodEx - Delivery Service :) \nNow, the good thing is
    they will never actually READ your book. So, all someone has to do is claim you
    said something - which is what i recommend - and bam, instant celebrity and a
    model wife."

<p><img src="/img/pinkelephant.gif" align=left hspace=6>The presentation is over. I am not the draw I imagined myself to be. Dipesh was not there to hear my dig on subaltern studies. All the better, as he probably would have thrown me out of the program. Nah! he is too nice for that. Anyways, had minimal required audience but they seemed to take my radical theories with composure. No one fell asleep. No hard questions.<br />
I managed to flub only a few words.<br />
I am so relieved. I can concentrate on finishing up the quarter and maybe think seriously about finding a publisher who can handle authors with fatwas against them.<br />
While my plight is over, a bunch of good people are coming up for their dissertation defenses. I will keep you posted. Also, this weekend is the <a href="http://southasia.uchicago.edu/Conference%20Poster.pdf">Peculiarities of Indian Democracy </a> conference with presentations by Sudipta Kaviraj, Arjun Appadurai, Dipesh Chakrabarty and Uday Mehta. Looking forward to that All-Star cast.</p>
