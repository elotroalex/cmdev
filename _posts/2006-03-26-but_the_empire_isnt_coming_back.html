  content: I couldn't tell if Osman was tongue-in-cheek when he said that the world
    would be a better place if the Caliphate were restored.  Who knows, or better,
    who cares?  My take from the article is that the the nostalgia among some for
    a Caliphate is a longing for some faraway time when Muslim communities were stronger
    in every way.  That is essentially a longing for ancient Arab and Ottoman empires,
    with a trumped up religious rationale. That is not surprising considering the
    condition of these peoples today -- who wouldn't want a return to a mythic past?   However,
    it would be mighty peculiar for me, a Muslim who is neither Arab nor Turk, to
    hope for such an empire.

  content: Well in the sense of Sunni Islam ..the nominal Khilafat did provide some
    structure to the Muslim world..this fragmentation of fatwa makers can in a way
    be attributed to those days.
