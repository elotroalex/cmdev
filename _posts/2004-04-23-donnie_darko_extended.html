<p><img src="/images/donnie.jpg" align="left" height="100" hspace=6>One of my favorite movies from 2001, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246578/">Donnie Darko</a> is getting an extended cut in the <b>cinemas</b>. Richard Kelly (writer/director) spilled some beans to the <a href="http://www.empireonline.co.uk/site/features/interviews/interviews.asp?IID=91">Empire Magazine</a>:</p>
<div id="blockquoted"> It will expand the meaning of the film and offer more clues and more solutions to the puzzle and create an additional layer of mystery for the audience. There really is a tremendous amount of new material - some of which will surprise even the most die-hard fans. One thing I am really excited about is the new sound. I was really unhappy with the mix that we had in the first cut. We never really had time to go in properly and design the sound. We can go back and really get it right this time. I'm very excited about the new sonic elements of the film.</div>
<p>I am really looking forward to this. My guess is that the Grandma Death storyline will be fleshed out and maybe the noah wyle character. Hopefully, it will answer whether Donnie wakes up in an alternate reality or does he only have the power of knowledge? Not so sure about the music bit. I happen to love that score and the soundtrack was perfect.</p>
