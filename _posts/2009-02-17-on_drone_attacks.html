<p>From <a href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2009/02/us_airstrike_in_paki.php">The Long War Journal</a></p>
<blockquote><p>There have been 36 recorded cross-border attacks and attempts in Pakistan this year, according to numbers compiled by The Long War Journal. Twenty-nine of these attacks took place since Aug. 31. There were only 10 recorded strikes during 2006 and 2007 combined.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plus, the six in 2009 - so far.</p>
<p>From Micah Zenko, <a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/02/17/reassessing_af_pak_strategy?mode=PF">Reassessing 'Af-Pak' strategy</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
This exponential growth of the Predator strikes against senior and mid-level lieutenants, however, has not helped to prevent the spread of jihadist sympathies in the tribal regions and beyond, nor has it slowed the stream of militants and material into Afghanistan. In fact, according to Pakistani intelligence reports, refugees from Afghanistan have flocked to the Taliban by the hundreds to avenge the drones' killings of innocent civilians.</p>
<p>The central reason for the Taliban's growth is that the United States has never had a comprehensive Af-Pak strategy.</p></blockquote>
