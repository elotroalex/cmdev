<p>I was in Cambridge to participate in a <a href="http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/research/centre/events/2006/BeyondDeconstructionCFP06L.html">workshop</a> on colonial knowledge. I had no idea what I was walking into, but with dacoit on my side [a complete surprise], I figured it will be ok. It was great, actually. The participants were equal parts Africanists, SAists - historians and anthropologists. It may have been that I was the first up, and everyone was still in travel mode, but it was shock and awe! Ok, not quite that dramatic. My discussant, Chris Bayly did a fine job of showing who's boss. </p>
<p>As expected, the Cambridge crowd was disdainful of poco scholars. As expected, the Chicago crowd showed their mean upbringing. What was unexpected, were the Africanists who _really_ oughta look more closely at India. In fact, as SAists, we should look to do such cool projects - to trace the policies and personnel that get tested and trained in India before implementing in Africa. I certainly have a new angle for my job interview [the all-too-eager collaborater!].</p>
<p>It was a rousing success of peer validation for me. Which, I assure you, never happens.</p>
