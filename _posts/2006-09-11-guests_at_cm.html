<p><img src="/images/lapata.jpg"/>I like having people over. I like throwing parties. I am, what the kids call, a sociable person. That spirit is often in practice at CM - dacoit, farangi, nadia, rob and others have pitched in, now and then. And now, I introduce to you <i>lapata</i> [I will let her tell you what that means].</p>
<p>lapata holds a phd in south asian literature. More often, she holds a martini glass askew, with an absurd, charming little laugh. She knows that the world is a bad place and she plans on telling you that as soon as we all sit down and get comfortable.</p>
<p>She will be piping in, now and then, when I am not looking. </p>
<p>In addition, I have given farangi some assignments. Let's make sure that he delivers.</p>
<p>Also: Happy Birthday, Aamir!</p>
