<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungnyemun">Sungnyemun</a>, was built by Tae-Jo in 1396, the first king of the Lee dynasty, to keep the Pakistanis out of Seoul.</p>
<p>I just loved the continuities in the two pictures below. One is from the <a href="http://www.usc.edu/isd/archives/arc/libraries/eastasian/korea/resources/kda-taylor.html">Reverend Corwin & Nellie Taylor Collection</a> and dates from early 20th c. and the other is from yesterday - or something. Also, I was kidding about Pakistanis. In 1396, they were too busy invading China to pay attention to Seoul. </p>

<p>Totally making my day was this line from the wiki entry on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeong_Mong-ju">Jeong Mong-ju</a>: "Jeong was murdered in 1392 by five men on the Sonjukkyo Bridge in Gaeseong, following a party held for him by his political rival Yi Seonggye (who became King Taejo of Joseon). This bridge, now in North Korea has now become a national monument, and a brown spot on one of the stones is said to be a bloodstain of his which turns red when it rains."</p>
<p>Historical memory. Ah.</p>
