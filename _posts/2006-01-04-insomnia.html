  content: The subaltern t-shirt is fantastic. Also the 'do nafal' quote is brilliant.

<p>I have had a stressful week or more. </p>
<p>And last night, found myself staring at the ceiling around 3:30 in the morning. The night before I had sat up watcing the 2005 Spelling Bee contest. Which was great, because all of the five finalists were desi kids: overclocked for perfection, of course. The kid, Sameer, who came in second was freaking me out with how good he was. As Rajeev quipped, 'man, they have 5000 years of memorization practice built into their genes'. I must have a different gene pool because I can't remember jack.</p>
<p>In any case, as they say, <a href="http://www.spreadshirt.com/shop.php?sid=11853&op=articles">Idle hands are the tools of the Devil</a>. There is no markup on the shirts, but if you DO buy one, please tell me. I really want the Provincializing Chicago and the Mughals one. No, I want the Subaltern one. For the record, I cannot afford to buy any of them. </p>
<p>As my dear abba gee would say, 'do nafal parho aur so jaoo'.</p>
