<p><img src="/images/secretthings.jpg" alt="" hspace="6" align="left" />Why do I persist in thinking that French cinema has something to say? Why?<br />
We escaped tonight to a movie and saw <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/secretthings/"> Secret Things </a> by savant auteur Jean-Claude Brisseau. I would pitch it as In the Company of Men meets Marquis deSade meets Damien meets a CRACK PIPE.<br />
It started out fairly innocuously and for an hour...it was decent. I distinctly remember thinking, "hey, this is decent".<br />
And then, either the filmmakers ran out of medication or went on crack because what was so far a satirization of sexual office politics turned into melodramatic Satan-wanna-be-bad-guy-&amp;-Lady-in-a-veil-with-a-falcon-on-shoulder-&amp;-Chateau-with-standard-orgy&amp; Justine. Just like that. No warning. Suddenly, I found myself laughing my ass off at dialogue like "He is not dead because he was never born as we are never alive". And watching in amazement as a spirit falcon chewed the flesh of a newly dead. huh???! Can you tell me about the falcon lady? A metaphor? A simile? A ghost? I just want to know.</p>
<p>Someone please do an intervention in France. Please. Take their cameras away. Have them watch John Ford and Abbas Kiarostami.<br />
I used to love french cinema. I still do. But this is the seventh straight strike out.  So, hiatus for me.<br />
Mon Dieu.</p>
