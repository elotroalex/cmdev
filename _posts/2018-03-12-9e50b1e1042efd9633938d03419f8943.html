<p>Hi,<br />
I am an PhD student in the anthropology department at the University of Pennsylvania. I was wondering if you are planning to do an interview with Ammara Maqsood on her new book 'The Pakistani Middle Class'? I think it would be a great addition to your XQs section. </p>
<p>I would love to do the interview if possible. Let me know. Thanks.</p>
<p>Best,<br />
