  content: Thanks for the link. I am slightly wary, however, of generalizations about
    Sindh being a sort of tolerant, Sufi inspired safe haven. While it may be true
    about aspects of Sindh and Sindhi culture, generalizations like this turn a blind
    eye to the persecution and harassment certain religious minorities (Ahmadi's being
    one) are facing in Pakistan, and especially so in Sindh, where such bigotry appears
    to take on a more zealous character. Might not have anything to do with terrorism,
    but it is violence nonetheless.
