<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">India&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Revolutionary Inheritance is a book about the continuing political potential of a young man hanged by the British colonial state almost ninety years ago. Executed at twenty-three for &acirc;&euro;&tilde;conspiring to wage war against the King-Emperor&acirc;&euro;&trade;, Bhagat Singh remains an iconic figure in contemporary India. Recalled as <i>shaheed-e-azam</i> (&acirc;&euro;&tilde;the great martyr&acirc;&euro;&trade;), the story of his life and death draws adherents from across the political spectrum, and as this book argues, compels a peculiar sense of responsibility among the living. Bhagat Singh is not, I argue, a pliant figure susceptible to easy appropriation in the present, but rather manifests as a disruptive, spectral presence, calling the living to account and guiding them toward a certain understanding of what might constitute effective political action. What does it mean, then, to take the dead revolutionary seriously as an active interlocutor and instigator in twenty-first century South Asian politics?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attached extract sets out the stakes for such an argument, exploring how the book works against an existing historiography that simply laments the &acirc;&euro;&tilde;misuse&acirc;&euro;&trade; and &acirc;&euro;&tilde;abuse&acirc;&euro;&trade; of Bhagat Singh&acirc;&euro;&trade;s name while setting out to uncover the &acirc;&euro;&tilde;real&acirc;&euro;&trade; figure and what he &acirc;&euro;&tilde;really&acirc;&euro;&trade; fought and died for. I argue instead that Bhagat Singh&acirc;&euro;&trade;s potentiality was always phantasmal in form. The revolutionary needs to be understood for the <i>promise</i> he represents, rather than for any particular <i>programme</i> he may or may not have elaborated in 1920s colonial India. In focusing on those aspects of Bhagat Singh&acirc;&euro;&trade;s story and struggle that appear portable and reiterable across time and space, we can begin to think seriously about the long-term legacies of revolutionary politics and the reverberations of anti-colonial martyrdom in post-colonial India. We can open a discussion about why this young man from a small village outside Lyallpur, Punjab, remains instructive for thinking about the form and contours of a militant life in the present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book is thus interested to ask how historians and other scholars might take seriously the question of &acirc;&euro;&tilde;afterlives&acirc;&euro;&trade; and the operation of ghosts and spectres on the shifting terrains where they work and study. But it is also concerned with the more directly political question of why anti-colonial histories remain so compelling and challenging in our global, post-colonial present. What can be learned if we address those revenant figures from struggles past, not as sentimental remnants or heroic precedents but as comrades in a fight that continues? As signals of &acirc;&euro;&tilde;unfinished business&acirc;&euro;&trade; and exhortations toward a freedom that has not yet been secured? Having followed closely the gaze and guidance of a spectral Bhagat Singh, <i>India&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Revolutionary Inheritance</i> represents one attempt to grapple with this vital problem-space within contemporary political thought.</span></p>
