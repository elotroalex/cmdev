(trans. <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/islamicstudies/people/tenure-stream-professors/prashant-keshavmurthy">Prashant Keshavmurthy</a>)</strong></p>
<p>The Lord be praised &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; for autumn&acirc;&euro;&trade;s month is here,<br />
The month of shrinking and swelling vineyards.<br />
So much do they harvest and heap the grape<br />
Now the vineyard teems like the milky-way.<br />
For when the grape leaf, rainbow-like, is many-hued<br />
The rainbow seems to hold grape clusters.<br />
Blue purses hang from yellow leaves,<br />
In each blue purse a largish seed of grape-flower.</p>
<p>And in the heart of that seed&acirc;&euro;&trade;s vinous flower<br />
Are hidden ten sacks all concealing musk.<br />
And that fruit&acirc;&euro;&trade;s as if it were someone unwell,<br />
Of double aspect among all its limbs and body, One of its cheeks yellow, the other red.<br />
Of them one&acirc;&euro;&trade;s breathless, the other jaundiced.</p>
<p>That pomegranate&acirc;&euro;&trade;s like a pregnant woman<br />
And in her belly &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; a fistful of sons.<br />
She won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t give birth until you beat her to the ground.<br />
And when the child&acirc;&euro;&trade;s born its birth&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the same as eating it.<br />
A mother gives birth to a child, or two or three.<br />
Then why&acirc;&euro;&trade;s this pomegranate a mother of three hundred?<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p>Until a mother doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t deliver her womb of her child<br />
She doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t lay it on the bed, this much is obvious and no secret.<br />
In her womb has she prepared for the child a yellow bed<br />
Within which is apparent a child&acirc;&euro;&trade;s form.</p>
<p>Now shall I speak of the grape-child&acirc;&euro;&trade;s qualities<br />
Each of which it contains to excess.<br />
Like a woman is the grape musk-colored<br />
And has a belly like that of a musk-vessel.<br />
Within its belly are one soul and three hearts<br />
And each of its three hearts is three bone-bits.<br />
They say an animal has a soul in its heart.<br />
But it has a bony heart and life and soul.</p>
<p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d never known the soul to have a color but its soul<br />
Is the color of a poppy in a poppy-field.<br />
The soul&acirc;&euro;&trade;s odorless but its perfume<br />
Is like that of musk, ambergris and willow.<br />
The grape is black and like the moon unsurprisingly<br />
For blackness describes the moving moon.<br />
It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s fault is no other than that it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s grown pregnant<br />
When yet only a fresh young girl.<br />
It grew pregnant without a husband like Mary</p>
<p>But this tale&acirc;&euro;&trade;s pleasanter and more remarkable than that.<br />
For while Mary grew pregnant by the mouth<br />
This daughter of the vine has neither lips nor mouth.<br />
&acirc;&euro;&tilde;Imran&acirc;&euro;&trade;s daughter [i.e. Mary] was pregnant with a son<br />
While the grape&acirc;&euro;&trade;s daughter&acirc;&euro;&trade;s pregnant with a soul.<br />
There &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; the soul of the lord of all the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s creatures.<br />
Here &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; the wine of the lord of all the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s creatures.<br />
If the Jews resolved to kill Jesus<br />
On killing this one are all Muslims resolved.<br />
The former they seized, tortured and killed.<br />
The latter too they seize and torture &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; how is that?<br />
The former raised the dead in ones or twos by miracle.<br />
The latter revives the soul of all the age&acirc;&euro;&trade;s people.<br />
That mortal&acirc;&euro;like immortal was the Holy Ghost.<br />
This mortal&acirc;&euro;like immortal is a creature.<br />
Look how that one suffered by their killing.<br />
Look how this one suffers by their killing.<br />
That one, after the cruelty, was delivered of all pain.<br />
This one, after the cruelty, is delivered of all pain.<br />
That one found a place in heaven while this one<br />
Takes its place in the hands of commanders and viziers</p>
<p>Such as the hand of the vizier of the king of the East whose hand<br />
Is heavy, not with wine, but with magnanimity.<br />
The sun of viziers, Ahmad Abdus Samad who<br />
Is not only the sun of viziers but the sun of all men.<br />
That forebear of all the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s forebears,<br />
Like the vanguard of a straight spear from Khatt,<br />
Greater than all the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s men by two details<br />
Is he, greater by two: by his heart and by speech.</p>
<p>Such tearing and sewing by the pen&acirc;&euro;&trade;s tip you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll never see,<br />
Tearing and sewing by pen-tip and finger.<br />
By his bounty did everything probable grow certain<br />
And whatever was certain in his lineage is probable.<br />
He&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not narrow sighted for narrow&acirc;&euro;sightedness<br />
Is wretchedness and weakness in the affairs of the great.<br />
Bestowing dinars, he claims a noble reputation<br />
Knowing that time in all events is passing.<br />
To the nobles and attendants of the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s king<br />
Is he both bestower of wealth and its claimant.</p>
<p>For the kingdom&acirc;&euro;&trade;s like a body and in that body<br />
Are these attendants veins and arteries.<br />
The physician&acirc;&euro;&trade;s duty lies in recognizing the vein<br />
How it is when pulsing and how when not.<br />
When it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s pulsing he weakens its force<br />
And, if not, there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s fear of choking by inflammation.<br />
When it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not pulsing he administers strength<br />
Or else the kingdom&acirc;&euro;&trade;s heart risks jaundice.</p>
<p>This business of ministership, run smoothly by this lord,<br />
Is not a business for just anybody and everybody.<br />
Each pursues his own benefit and interest<br />
While he has in mind the world-king&acirc;&euro;&trade;s benefit and interest.<br />
Never does he permit himself petty-mindedness<br />
For petty-mindedness harms the great.</p>
<p>To the gnat of cruelty and sorrow is he a great elephant<br />
And to the ant of corruption is he a fierce lion-cub.<br />
The king&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the kingdom&acirc;&euro;&trade;s body and he its heart.<br />
The kingdom&acirc;&euro;&trade;s like the Qur&acirc;&euro;&trade;an and he its meaning.<br />
The kingdom&acirc;&euro;&trade;s like a meadow and the peasantry its herd,<br />
The king&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the sheep-capturer and the minister the shepherd.<br />
The army&acirc;&euro;&trade;s like the sheep-dogs and the enemy like the wolf.<br />
And this business of dogs, wolf and sheep rests with the shepherd.<br />
A shepherd looks over us so nothing disturbs the sheep.</p>
<p>Neither is the wolf safe from him, nor are the dogs exhausted.<br />
Never with the weak is he severe<br />
Although you know him to be severe.<br />
Till on the highest and lowest scales does sound the melody,<br />
Till on the flowering tree sings the wild pigeon<br />
May his life and person find neither equal nor limit<br />
As knowledge and greatness are without equal and limit.<br />
May he rest in spring for as often as spring returns.<br />
May he rest in autumn for as often as autumn returns.</p>
