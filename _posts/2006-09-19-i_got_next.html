  content: hurrah!  i've seen her stuff at a few shows and like it immensely (i am
    a sucker for miniatures, be they mughal, ottoman, or postmodern).  also very pleased
    to see gawande and david macaulay and adrian leblanc on the list.

<p>Shazia Sikander wins the <a href="http://www.macfound.org/site/c.lkLXJ8MQKrH/b.2070789/apps/nl/content2.asp?content_id={6937B829-1442-4ED0-81AB-CA3A6A203211}&notoc=1">MacArthur Fellowship</a>. A fine artiste of miniatures and installations, Sikander brings the grand total of desi 'geniuses' to ? [Atul Gawande is the other desi winner this year. Ali Akbar Khan won it in 1991 & Ayesha Jalal in 1998 {thx, dk}] Sikander came to Chicago in 1999 or 2000. Homi Bhabha introduced her. I had some wine with chocolate. Sikander gets $500,000 cash in small bills over five years. </p>
