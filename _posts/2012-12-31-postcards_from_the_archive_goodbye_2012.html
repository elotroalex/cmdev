<p>Last year it was Sepoy&acirc;&euro;&trade;s essays that were collected in a book, and this year, a collection of Lapata&acirc;&euro;&trade;s essays and art, the second CM book, <i><a href="http://www.foxheadbooks.com/?p=684">The Little Book of Terror</a>, </i>was <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/better_with_tablas/the_little_book_of_terror_launch_and_art_opening_in_philadelphia.html">published</a> by Farangi&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <a href="http://www.foxheadbooks.com/">Foxhead Books</a>. You can read some reviews of <i>TLBT </i>at the new CM page, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}cm_books">CM Books</a>.</p>
<p>We had some terrific guest essays this year. Rohit edited and wrote much of the CM series on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/potpurri/_socialism_secularism_and_the_shifting_goalposts_of_indian_democracy.html">political life and public culture in South Asia</a>, including fantastic essays on the anti-Sikh <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/potpurri/the_stain_of_memory.html">pogroms</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/potpurri/bal_thackerays_poisonous_legacies.html">Bal Thackery&acirc;&euro;&trade;s legacies</a>. Neelika contributed a fabulous two-part essay on South African Desis (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/everyones_got_their_indian_-_i_separations.html">here</a>, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/potpurri/everyones_got_their_indian_-_ii_entanglements.html">here</a>). Tipu Sultan contributed a powerful <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/imperial_watch/in_and_out_of_kingdoms.html">memoir</a> of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;the very first American gated communities ever built in the twentieth century: the exemplary, model &acirc;&euro;&tilde;suburb.&acirc;&euro;&trade;&acirc;&euro;¬ù <a href="http://www.mafarooqi.com/">Musharraf Ali Farooqi</a> jumped <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/feet_first_-_essays_on_maula_jatt_i_.html">feet first</a> in the proposed series on Maulat Jatt, and apparently no one dared write a follow up to that riot of an essay. Sara Waheed&acirc;&euro;&trade;s<a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/literature_in_the_oil_age_a_review_of_goat_days_.html"> review</a> of <i>Goat Days</i> was a win, as was Hussein Omar&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/imperial_watch/first_terrorist_review_of_maia_ramnaths_haj_to_utopia.html">review</a> of Mia Ramnath&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <i>Hajj to Utopia</i>.</p>
<p>Speaking of reviews, Farangi <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/imperial_watch/trashthestache.html">said</a> his once a year hello with a review of the enjoyable Friedman-bashing book including an interview with its author, Belen Fernandez. Lapata continued to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/optical_character_recognition/reviews_sheviews.html">review</a> books. Don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t miss her reviews of <i><a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/imperial_watch/read_think_burn_repeat_as_necessary.html">Habibi</a> </i>and Marina Warner&acirc;&euro;&trade;s <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/potpurri/7179.html">Stranger Magic: Charmed States and the Arabian Nights</a>. Sepoy wrote perhaps the only critical <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/optical_character_recognition/in_golden_hues.html">review</a> of Musharraf Ali Farooqi&acirc;&euro;&trade;s highly acclaimed novel <i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BetweenClayAndDust">Between Clay and Dust</a></i> out there. I reviewed some books as well (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/imperial_watch/patriot_acts.html">here</a>, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/imperial_watch/native_apologist.html">here</a>), including&Acirc;&nbsp;<a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/potpurri/archive_remix_ii_empires_ways_of_knowing.html">WTWFA</a>.</p>
<p>Sepoy&acirc;&euro;&trade;s six-part essay on Lahore (start <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/slow_burn_lahore.html">here</a>) was the highlight of the year, here at CM. He also started to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/berlin_sketchbook_i.html">write about Berlin</a> and we hope that he continues to do so. Other notables from Sepoy&acirc;&euro;&trade;s pen are his <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/optical_character_recognition/who_lies_beneath_your_spell.html">love letter</a> to Agha Shahid Ali and a somber reflection on Pakistani <a href="{{site.baseurl}}archives/homistan/dead_bodies_amongst_.html">Hazaras</a>.</p>
