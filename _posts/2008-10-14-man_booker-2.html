<blockquote><p>"I was in Australia and New York and here in England, I was at Oxford for a few years. At least two of those places were very egalitarian, and this was Sydney and New York and when I came back I had to a large extent forgotten what it had been to be well off in India," he told The Australian Online. </p>
<p>I had no embarrassment about doing many things for myself that would (normally) be done by servants. I think I looked at people in a different way and I am not claiming to be non-middle class back in India but I am conscious of the fact that there are people around me who are servants and I am curious of what they are like."</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh that India, only when you leave it, will you learn to endure it. And <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24500110-16947,00.html">write about</a> its contradictions</a>. What a fate.</p>
<p>Thank Allah for egalitarian Oxford.</p>
