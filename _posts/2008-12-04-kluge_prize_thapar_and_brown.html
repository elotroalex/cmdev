<p>What great news! The Library of Congress' 2008 <a href="http://www.loc.gov/loc/kluge/prize/">Kluge Prize</a> has been given to historians <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iRNrTVhq4bWYiFSWCkcu1MLVTSrgD94RHAMG0">Romila Thapar and Peter Brown</a>. </p>
<p>I am huge admirer of these fine historians. In addition to her scholarship on antiquity and medieval Indian history, Thapar is the pre-eminent public intellectual with a staunch commitment to a secular India. Her work leading up to, and after, the 1992 Babri Masjid riots is one of the clearest acts of public bravery by a historian. Peter Brown's lucid prose has often been gushed up at CM. So Awesome!</p>
<p>There are better <a href="http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2008/08-225.html">profiles</a> at the LoC site. </p>
