<p>Hey man,<br />
Just wanted to tell you that I've succeeded in publishing something non-academic! Here's a storified slice of my ethnographic work, published in the _Believer_: . Hope you like it. If you really like it, please consider giving it a boost here on the site.<br />
In other news: school year is wrapping up here at last, getting busy processing tenure file (!). Wife's good, children are a bit...too good. Sending you all bests from Santa Barbara!<br />
