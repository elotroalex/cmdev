<p>Whole-heartedly agree with you, and a pity that most of us are so blind to this phenomenon that not only do we not address or acknowledge it, but actively deny it as well. I think this is part of a tendency that every generation of every people have wherein they choose to talk about 'dark-ages' exclusively in past tense, and consider themselves to be a part of post-civilised society; if snyone objects, off with their heads!</p>
<p>And as this tide of bigotry rushes in, it brings with itself an enormous load of PR-driven political flotsam. The voter is not looking for Abraham Lincoln; (s)he's looking for Lady Gaga! And as for the politicians, the democratic process is just a lottery, albeit with some skill involved. Hence, Narendra Modi, and his Poker Face.<br />
