<p>So, while I am moving hosts...btw, porting a Movable Type installation is a muthahumpa, I am contemplating switching over to Word Press. It's PHP as opposed to lame horse Perl ... and it's guaranteed free. Not that that has any real appeal to me, I like paying developers for their work.<br />
But I know for sure that php site will be faster and sweeter than a perl.</p>
<p>Despair not, gentle reader, CM will be back in action later today. On MT 3.0 or MT 2.6 or WP or something.</p>
