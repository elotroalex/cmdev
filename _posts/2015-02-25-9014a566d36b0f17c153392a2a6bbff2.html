<p>The greatest difference betweem islam and christianity is that christians have personal relationship with God who is LOVE. God is love! Also, christians are saved by the grace of God, salvation is a free GIFT of God's grace. We dont have to save ourselves. We simply receive salvation by faith because of God's love and grace for us. Also, our God is a God of power who heals our bodies, speaks to us and guides us individually and has a personal plan for each of our lives. In islam Allah saved nobody, he heals nobody, he speaks to nobody, he has no personal relationship with anybody and he is not love. Christianity is personal intimate relationship with personal living real God and islam is only a set of religious rules and ceremonies.<br />
