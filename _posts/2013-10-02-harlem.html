<p>Recently, a Sikh man was called "terrorist" and "Osama" and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/nyregion/chronicling-anti-sikh-violence-and-now-a-victim.html?_r=0">assaulted</a> near his house - in Harlem. I wrote <a href="http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/27/a-stranger-on-lennox-avenue/">about</a> it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is the attack on Mr. Singh an event that bears a relationship to incidents of violence against minorities around the globe? His is, after all, a singular story. Yet, all the other cases of crimes against minorities are also unique. Each represents a member of a community chosen as a target and then subject to annihilation &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; legal or physical. To resist such erasure, to speak out against the attackers, to educate the community, to build networks of support, are all necessary acts that depend on proper contextualization of the crime.</p></blockquote>
