  content: What would top off this week of victories would be an indictment of Karl
    Rowe, Lewis Libby, and Dick Cheney in the grand jury investigation. We'll see
    tomorrow.

  content: I wonder why Capitol Hill is so quite about Iran. I think Meirs and Scooter
    (I like the name though, it reminds me of my Italian Vespa in Pakistan) are the
    reasons.

    a wonderful thing, too.

<p>I won't say that this trumps the '92 World Cup win by Pakistan....but it comes close. The Grand Slam and the el Duque in the 9th were the highlights for me. Seeing Bush Sr. cheering the 'stros was also a moment. Of intense hilarity, of course.</p>
<p>My condolences to my peep, Rajeev, who had the misfortune of rootin' for the 'stros. </p>
<p>Harriet Miers goes back to passing memos to Bush.</p>
<p>Scooter Libby does not pass Go and fails to collect $200. He does succeed in collecting 5 indictments from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Fitzgerald">Patrick Fitzgerald</a> - the modern day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Ness">Eliot Ness</a>.</p>
