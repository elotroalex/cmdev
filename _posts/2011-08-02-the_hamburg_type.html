<p>I recently visited Hamburg and decided, on a lark, to only photograph street typography. The results are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery/sets/72157627214107543/">here</a>. Enjoy.</p>
<p>Some of the photos document the Iranian traders of carpets who came to Hamburg in the 1870s and 80s. There is also one photo of love, scream.</p>
