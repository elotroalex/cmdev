  content: 'I''m sorry: I tried to watch it twice, and both times had to just turn
    it off. It''s almost funny for about two minutes -- the faux bad translation schtick
    is dumb, I''m sorry, because it doesn''t even come close to ringing true except
    in the most cliched, stereotyped, racist sense -- and the other fifteen minutes
    is just assault on a deceased equine. Yellow Peril and Bush-Bashing just isn''t
    worth that much effort.'
