<p>Gentle Readers, </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Where-Wild-Frontiers-Are-Imagination/dp/1935982060">book</a> was launched last week. It was lovely, lovely, lovely, to have so many of my dearest friends there. Lovely to talk with new friends and lovelier still to be bathed in so much love. Have I used the word "love" enough yet? But that is the thing which remains with me after a week. </p>
<p>As I looked out at the amazing space in the Asian American Writers' Workshop, I just saw so many dear faces - and I would have you know, a LOT of people who were commenting at CM in 2004 and 2005 and you know, were cool before cool was cool. </p>
<p>A rather whirlwind - metaphorically and literally - tour of US of A is now over. I would like to tell you about the following things, if I can find any time to do so:</p>
<p>1. Driving down farm roads in central Texas, visiting graves of Czech settlers, and trees where Mexican "runners" were hung and such trees continue to be revered. Such usage of memory in such small towns, which were sites of much historical violence remains an obsession of mine, and I suspect I will have to write this out of my system soon. </p>
<p>2. Have you ever waited for 5 hours in a DMV office in Chicago? And then in an IRS office in Chicago? No? </p>
<p>3. Sunset Park in Brooklyn - home of famous authors and bon vivant personalities is a wonderful place. It boasts some amazing views of sunsets from its rooftops. This I remember.</p>
<p>3a. An Empire Cake is delicious beyond your wildest imagination. But only when SJN makes it.</p>
<p>4. Joseph Rykwert's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Seduction-Place-History-Future-Cities/dp/0375700447">The Seduction of Place: The History and Future of the City </a> contains a wonderful 6 page rendering of the many social utopianists of the late 19th century. I recommend this book also for its discussion of urban planning and the history of Manhattan & burroughs.</p>
<p>5. Khizr, an old obsession of mine, is renewed once again. I have an urge to tell you stories from Nizami, from Sachal Sarmast and from Uch Sharif. Think Green.</p>
<p>There is more, about Berlin (a book) and Bombay (a book and a movie) and sundry affairs but classes start next week and I am so far behind life that I cannot even tell you. </p>
<p>But here, just now, I wanted to say: I love you, and thank you.</p>
<p>ps. Any graphic designers/tshirt designers around. I need to commission (ahem) a tshirt for WTWFA.</p>
