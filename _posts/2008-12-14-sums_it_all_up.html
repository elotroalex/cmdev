  content: You know they're going to spin the fact that <i>only</i> one journalist
    threw shoes as evidence that the vast majority of pre-screened Iraqi journalists
    approve of the job Bush did in Iraq.....

  content: Even better than Friedman's encounter with the flying pie.  I hope the
    dude doesn't end up declared an enemy combatant, though...

  content: the only surprise in the whole incident for me was that Bush has pretty
    good reflexes and he handled the situation well later with his comments that in
    Saddams era this journalist would have been instantly shot. I think this disproves
    the claims that Bush has been talking gibberish during the past 8 years every
    time he was in front of a mic and a camera due to some long term neural damage
    caused by his alcoholic past. It was not the alcohol he actually really had no
    idea what he was talking about.
