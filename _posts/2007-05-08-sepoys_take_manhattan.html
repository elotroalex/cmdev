  content: Whoa!  This sounds awesome... the Thursday event might be too early for
    a weekday (for me to get outta work), but will definitely try and attend at least
    one of these events...Thanks!

<p>If you are in or around NYC and you care about raging against the machine, then do I have the event for you: <a href="http://synchroni-cities.blogspot.com/2007/05/remembering-1857-10th-and-11th-may-new.html">Remembering 1857</a>. Our own bulleyah is playing the role of Mangal Pandey. Do attend. And someone live-blog. I will try and mark the event - digitally.</p>
