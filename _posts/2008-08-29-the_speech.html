<p>I don't really need to analyze and parse what Barack Obama <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/president/conventions/videos/20080828_OBAMA_SPEECH.html">said last night</a>- countless others will do it for you. I will just tell you, in my opinion, that in its mundane parts it was easily the best political speech of this genre, i.e., politician wanting to get elected, narrates positions; in its best parts, it transcended all standards by which such things need to be measured.&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will do my part - in Ohio, no less.</p>
