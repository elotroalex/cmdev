<p>I have to admit that I am thrilled at the positive response to the Polyglot Manifesto. I wanted to point out that over at <a href="http://rhineriver.blogspot.com/2006/05/hacking-archive.html">Rhine River</a> Nathanael makes a great case for hacking the archive via a digital camera. While I was in the Punjab University archives on research, I must have taken over a thousand pictures - often of title pages alone because the catalogs sucketh so much. I should def. put them up on flickr for anyone else who may need to go to PU. Thanks, Nathanael!</p>
<p>And Elizabeth at <a href="http://verbalprivilege.blogspot.com/2006/05/invention-of-hatay-part-i-told.html">Verbal Privilege</a> promises a polyglot way to present her paper on Hatay. Good luck, e!</p>
