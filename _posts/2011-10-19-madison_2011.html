<p>Ahem. </p>
<p>It is the Annual Awesomeness that is the Madison conference - this is the 40th one! Big times now. I will be on two panels - giving a paper on something I am quite excited about and discussing a set of papers elsewhere. I wish there was a way to link to my panels but that technology is currently unavailable. You are welcome to go <a href="http://southasiaconference.wisc.edu/schedule/schedule.asp">here</a> and kinda browse around, however.</p>
<p>Friends and scholarship. What more can a historian want?</p>
