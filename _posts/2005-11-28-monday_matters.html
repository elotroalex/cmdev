  content: wistfully, as i recollect my own adventures with my father and uncles,
    in farms all over southern Karnataka (unlike sepoy, i actually worked in the fields
    and even drove the bullock cart), i must admit there is something elevating about
    being bone tired after a day's work in the fields. a day in the dusty stacks of
    the reg or even clerical labor in a digital lab (field) just doesn't cut it. so
    sepoy, illinois has much farm land and you could get the hell out of HP. don't
    give up your day job yet but being a weekend farmer ain't so bad.

  content: do we have to look at the fields with such nostalgia? isn't waiting at
    the b'lore traffic signals after a tiring day at college in any way elevating?
    all the traffic signals become my resting spots and contemplating centres about
    people who keep fiddling with their cells in chauffeur driven cars. that's where
    we live; why not accept it?

<p><img class="graphic" src="/img/cowcart.jpg"/>There must be a deep-boned tiredness that comes from working the field all day. Maybe that is what Gandhi wanted us to believe in. The soil under ones nail, the muscles stretched raw; a mind wiped clean. I haven't the faintest. As a child, I went many a times with my Dadaji or my Chachji to our patch of land. I loved the <i>bael gari</i> [cow-cart] and the lunch by the <a href="http://www.locatelli1.net/geogr/picture.php?ref=pak049&lg=en">TubeWell</a>. I especially loved my uncles tales of fighting off bears and <a href="http://www.ghosts-uk.net/modules/news/print.php?storyid=618">churails</a> [or <i>puchal paerey</i> as they say in Punjab]. But, I was just a visitor. Clad in me Jordache jeans, no doubt [holy shit, they still <a href="http://www.jordache.com/">exist</a>]. I think wistfully of all that and the feeling that a farmer must get because I toiled in the digital farm all day. It just doesn't hold the same satisfaction [or so I infer]. And the week stretches ahead of me. There is a 'review' due tomorrow. If the editor is reading this post, she is duly informed that it ain't happening before friday. So there. My cold is not giving up without a fight. </p>
