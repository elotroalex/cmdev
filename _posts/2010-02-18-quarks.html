<p><a href="http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2010/02/3-quarks-daily-prize-in-arts-literature.html">3 QUARKS DAILY PRIZE IN ARTS & LITERATURE</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are now going to do the Arts and Literature Prizes, and here's how it will work: we will soon begin accepting nominations for this prize. After the nominating period is over, there will be a round of voting by our readers which will narrow down the entries to the top twenty semi-finalists. After this period, we will take these top twenty voted-for nominees, and the four main daily editors of 3 Quarks Daily (Abbas Raza, Robin Varghese, Morgan Meis, and Azra Raza) will select six finalists from these, plus they may also add up to three wildcard entries of their own choosing. The three winners will be chosen from these by former U.S. Poet Laureate, Robert Pinsky, who, we are extremely pleased, has agreed to be the final judge.</p></blockquote>
<p>Go, nominate.</p>
