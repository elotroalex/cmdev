<p>For the first time I have got in touch with the reality of how arrogant we have Hindus have become just because we are in majority. For people, in majority are blessed and therefore ought to do every thing possible lift those in minority who are not so fortunate.<br />
I was born in Pakistan(then undivided India). Then too the Hindus ruled the roost even though they were in minority. landowners and big time traders were all Hindus. Tillers and laborers were Muslims.<br />
However, there is a confusion that is going through in my mind as I write this comment. Isn't it minority appeasement that has created Hindu dominated parties as a reaction. And haven't the minorities kept themselves in a cocoon with their Religious leaders not moving with time.<br />
