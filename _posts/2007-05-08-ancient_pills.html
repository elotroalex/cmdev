<p>Suketu Mehta's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/07/opinion/07mehta.html?ex=1336190400&en=086cf83134beb7e5&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">A Big Stretch</a>, NYT, May 7th, begins with chiding the USPTO for issuing "134 patents on yoga accessories and 2,315 yoga trademarks" but goes on to make a much-weaker analogy with pharmaceutical patents in India. Though, I agree with both of his points independently - you can't really trademark '<a href="http://www.google.com/patents?q=yoga&lr=&sa=N&start=30">yoga</a>' and generic medicenes are life-savers in the Third World - I don't really see the analogy between a practice and a product. The wisdom in the later case comes from billions of dollars in R&D [and yes, Big Pharma just leeches the federal grants]. </p>
<p>ps. A database made from ancient Sanskrit and Tamil texts, available in five international languages containing ayurvedic remedies and hundreds of yoga poses sounds awesomely cool.</p>
