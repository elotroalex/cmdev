<p><img src="/images/sunday.jpg"/>I _promise_ that CM will return to form soon enough. Been mulling over the cricket post for a while - though it keeps mutating. Keeping with the theme of promises of posts ahead, today's list: </p>
<ul>
<li>In anticipation of my cricket post, I would recommend this <a href="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/current/story/258645.html">explanation of ball swing</a>.
</li>
<li>Jonathan Dresner told me about the <a href="http://www.irancartoon.ir/gallery/album48?page=1">Exhibition of Holocaust Cartoons</a>. About as original and thought provoking as the Danish cartoons. I did get a chuckle out of <a href="http://www.irancartoon.com/120/occupation/Mohammad-Amin-Aghai/index.htm">this</a> one. Mostly for the usage of the Microsoft file system. But, more on these cartoons later.
</li>
<li>Martin Amis has a three-parter in <i>The Guardian</i>: <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1868732,00.html">one</a>, <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1868743,00.html">two</a> and <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1868746,00.html">three</a>. I present it sans analysis for now. One is forthcoming.
</li>
<li>Dave Davisson has a wonderful manifesto for us: <a href="http://patahistory.blogspot.com/2006/09/patahistory-manifesto.html">The Patahistory Manifesto</a>. Much to like, discuss. Will.
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the meantime, I am going to be in UK this week. If any readers want to meet up, a bunch of us will be <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=lord+john+russell+pub&near=London+WC1+UK&ie=UTF8&om=1&z=15&ll=51.528797,-0.123553&spn=0.012548,0.026479&iwloc=A</p>
<p>">here</a> Wed. night. In my absence, some one else may chime in. </p>
<p>ps. as to my traveling plans for tomorrow, here is what I <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/foto_decadent/1403878.html">expect</a>.</p>
