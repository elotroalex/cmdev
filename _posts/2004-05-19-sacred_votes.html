  content: "That doesn't even make ANY sense. The 69th President will take office
    in 2104. Bush's daughters just turned 21. That means that Bush 69 will have to
    be Bush 43's great grandson.\noh wait. \ni get it."

<p><img src="/images/bushjesus.jpg" hspace=6 align=left>It is ironic that Pakistan and Iraq are to be saved from the reign of Mullahs by Democracy. But what happens when democracy dictates bowing down before God? From <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0420/perlstein.php">Village Voice</a> comes a startling tale of Bush advisors meeting with Christian Apocalyptics about W.H.'s position on a Palestinian state. Their concern was that the Road Map for peace in the Middle East issued this past winter had caused anger within these organizations:</p>
<div class=quote><img src="/images/startquote.gif">Last spring, after President Bush announced his Road Map plan for peace in the Middle East, the Apostolic Congress co-sponsored an effort with the Jewish group Americans for a Safe Israel that placed billboards in 23 cities with a quotation from Genesis ("Unto thy offspring will I give this land") and the message, "Pray that President Bush Honors God's Covenant with Israel. Call the White House with this message." It then provided the White House phone number and the Apostolic Congress's Web address.<br />
In the interview with the Voice, Pastor Upton claimed personal responsibility for directing 50,000 postcards to the White House opposing the Road Map, which aims to create a Palestinian state. "I'm in total disagreement with any form of Palestinian state," Upton said. "Within a two-week period, getting 50,000 postcards saying the exact same thing from places all over the country, that resonated with the White House. That really caused [President Bush] to backpedal on the Road Map." <img src="/images/endquote.gif"></div>
<p><!--more--><br />
The Bush White House heard those concerns loud and clear. According to this article, senior advisors to Karl Rove and NSC Near East Desk met with the group to allay fears. In his subsequent <a href="http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article2686.shtml">meeting</a> with Sharon, George Bush effectively cut the Palestinians out of their own future. Why would the White House care about Christian fundamentalists? I am not one to play the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jesus/">Bush talks to God</a> card. Even though the evidence speaks to the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A37944-2003Jun26?language=printer">contrary</a>:</p>
<div class=quote><img src="/images/startquote.gif">Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Abu Mazen, meeting recently with militants to enlist their support for a truce with Israel, said that, when they met in Aqaba, President Bush had told him this: " God told me to strike at al Qaeda and I struck them, and then he instructed me to strike at Saddam [ Hussein], which I did, and now I am determined to solve the problem in the Middle East. If you help me I will act, and if not, the elections will come and I will have to focus on them.<img src="/images/endquote.gif"></div>
<p>I concede that he is a religious man but he is ALSO a politician. More than Godspeak is VoteSpeak. In this case, the United Pentecostal Church is a highly effective supra-organization that can mobilize votes in the South. Hence, he has to court groups who hope Israel-survives-until-Armageddon-so-Rapture-can-kill-them because these groups can bring the voters to the voting booths.</p>
<p>Similarly, he has to court Israeli Jewish Lobby who can possibly tilt Florida in his favor. Yesterday, he spoke to a rousing public at an <a href="http://www.axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/article_7879.shtml">AIPAC</a> gathering. Again, the rhetoric of religion informed this speech [to great applause]:</p>
<div class= quote><img src="/images/startquote.gif"> Our nation, and the nation of Israel, have much in common. We're both relatively young nations, born of struggle and sacrifice. We're both founded by immigrants escaping religious persecution in other lands. We have both built vibrant democracies, built on the rule of law and market economies. And we're both countries founded on certain basic beliefs: that God watches over the affairs of men, and values every life.<img src="/images/endquote.gif"></div>
<p>I would submit that this is a Bush White House micromanaging every single constituency, foreign policy be damned. Heck, no "policy" matters. This White House is only interested in one thing: Re-Election. Why? Because Bush 41 didn't get to a second term. Bush 41 destroyed Reagan's legacy by letting a fornicator into the Oval Office. Bush 43 will NOT repeat that mistake. The Christian fundies and the Israeli Lobby may seem contradictory voting blocs but they may bring him back to the office.</p>
