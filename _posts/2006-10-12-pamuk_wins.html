  content: Longest tease?  Has Vargas Llosa yet won?
---
<p>Ending the longest tease ever, the Nobel committee finally decided to give Pamuk the <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&storyID=2006-10-12T130217Z_01_L12862864_RTRUKOC_0_US-NOBEL-LITERATURE.xml">Literature</a> prize. Woulda made more sense last year, no? </p>
<p>We will have to wait for e.'s take but a list of his work: Cevdet Bey ve Ogullar&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Icirc;&copy;, 1979, Sessiz Ev (The Silent House), 1984, Beyaz Kale (The White Castle), 1985, Kara Kitap (Black Book), 1990, Yeni Hayat (New Life), 1995, Benim Adim Kirmizi (My Name is Red), 2000, Kar (Snow), 2002, Istanbul: Hatiralar ve Sehir (Istanbul: Memories of a City), 2005. I heartily recommend <i>My Name is Red</i> as a starting point.</p>
<p>As if to celebrate, it is SNOWING in Chicago. I kid you <a href="http://r-cam.uchicago.edu/view/index.shtml">not</a>.</p>
<p><b>update:</b> <a href="http://verbalprivilege.blogspot.com/2006/10/nobel-endeavour-against-pure-and.html">e</a> comes through! And reading about her autographed copy, I feel bad for not asking for an autograph a few years back when Pamuk visited Chicago. Oh well. </p>
