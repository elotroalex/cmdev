  content: You know, I find that Jaeger's <i>The Origins of Courtliness</i> is a bit
    more helpful than Elias, especially in that it has a much less Freudian outlook.  But
    then, Elias is a classic.

    <strong>his dusty materials</strong>

    Sepoy has, in an act which could be read as either benevolent or cruel (I'll pick the former), passed me a meme. My approach to memes is in spirit much like Sepoy's growling, but as a fellow pragmatist, and because it's rude to decline an invite, I ent...

<p><img src="/images/bookmeme.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Abdul-Walid of Acerbia [a distant cousin of the Akond of Swat] threw a <a href="http://vernacularbody.typepad.com/vernacularbody/2005/04/abdulwalid_read.html#comments">meme</a> my way. Which, I think is the first time this has happened in CM blogging history. I can't recall participating in any memes before. Usually because I avoid them like the plague. They tend either to make me look foolish or expose me from behind the veil. The sad truth is that in the past few years I have read very little that did not get into the diss. In fact, it is this whole blogging thing has made me read a lot more. But Abdul-Walid is a nice enough fella so let's roll with this one, shall we? Nothing better to do on this bored saturday.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>You're stuck inside Fahrenheit 450.&nbsp; Which book do you want to be?</em>: Hmmm, Do I want to burn? How about William T. Vollman's <u>Atlas</u>? It will be the proverbial fuel in the fire.</li>
<li><em>Have you ever had a crush on a fictional character?</em>: All the time. Just last week, I fell in love with Jay Gatsby, again. A young sepoy, I recall, was obsessed with Sherlock Holmes. Umm. Just to get back up on Kinsey scale, let me also mention Alison from <u>The Magus</u> - always had a soft spot for her.</li>
<li><em>The last book you bought is?</em>: I bought Murakami's <u>Kafka on the Shore</u> and Norbert Elias' <u>The Civilizing Process</u></li>
<p>.</p>
<li><em>What are you currently reading?</em>: Andre Wink's <u>Al-Hind, The Making of the Indo-Islamic World, Vol. 2: The Slave Kings and the Islamic Conquest, 11th-13th Centuries</u> and <u>Al-Hind, The Making of the Indo-Islamic World, Vol. 3: Indo-Islamic Society 14th-15th Centuries</u>. Oh, and Bernard Porter's <u>The Absent-Minded Imperialist</u>. Sorry.</li>
<li><em>Five books you would take to a deserted island?</em>: Do we have to take books or cds to deserted islands? Can't I take some friends? Some of these fun and erudite bloggers? Like Abdul-Wahid and Amardeep Singh and Ms. World and Sumana? If books it is: <u>Hobson-Jobson</u> [for my obsession with funny words], Attar's <u>Conference of the Bird's</u> [for the beauty of language and wisdom], <u>Kulliyat-i Faiz Ahmed Faiz</u> [for I can read him until eternity rolls around], <u>Grimm's Fairy Tales</u>[stories must be read out aloud, even if one is alone] and <u>Black Water: An Anthology of Fantastic Literature</u> [wouldn't it be fun to get spooked on a deserted island?].</li>
<li><em>Who are you going to pass this to (three persons) and why?</em>: <a href="http://rob.ifanything.org/detriment/?p=341">Rob</a>, because he has a massive <a href="http://rob.ifanything.org/detriment/?p=338">hang-over</a>; <a href="http://cheznadezhda.blogharbor.com/blog/praktikesplace">Praktike</a>, because he will bring in the heat, and <a href="http://www.venialsin.com/index.php/archives/2005/04/02/memes-be-gone/">Sin</a>, because he is the paki Wilde.</ul>
