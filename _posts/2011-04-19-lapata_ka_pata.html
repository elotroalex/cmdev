<h3>This Is Not That Dawn: A Book Launch Symposium on the English Translation of Yashpal's Jhutha Sach. </h3>
<p>Jhutha Sach (1958-1960) is widely considered to be one of the masterpieces of Hindi literature, the most enduring of all works penned by militant Indian novelist, Yashpal (1903-1976). The pubication of the novel's much-anticipated English translation, <em>This Is Not That Dawn</em>, at last makes this important work available to a larger audience. </p>
<p>Please join the novel's translator, Anand, and scholars of South Asian and comparative literature as they discuss the politics of translation, Hindi in the world literary marketplace and the legacies of India's Partition in 1947. </p>
<p>With participants: </p>
<ul>
<ol>
Anand, Montreal-based journalist and translator of <em>This Is Not That Dawn</em></ol>
<li>Toral Gajarawala (NYU)</ol>
<li>Bilal Hashmi (NYU)
<li>Christi Merrill (University of Michigan)
<li>Daisy Rockwell (Dartmouth College)
</ul>
<p><strong>Location: 20 Cooper Square, 5th Floor</strong></p>
