<p>Hello! I was wondering if the Routledge (UK) volume proposed in 2013 on the aesthetics of narrations of the partition in South Asia in 1947 has been published? I cannot seem to find it on the Routledge website! I believe the tentative title was "The sentimental and the melodramatic: exploring Partition aesthetics." Is it the same intended volume as 2014 collection called "The Indian Partition in Literature and Films: History, Politics, and Aesthetics" edited by Mehta and Mookherjea-Leonard?</p>
<p>Thank you very much!<br />
