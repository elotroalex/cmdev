<p>I sincerely apologize for the absence, gentle Readers. Let it be known that I have been <a href="http://twitter.com/sepoy">tweeting</a> in my absence here, and I wrote a very short note on <a href="http://www.timeoutmumbai.net/books/book_review_details.asp?code=540">Ismat Chughtai</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>These essays showcase the best of Chughtai's range and mastery as a writer â€” they are erudite, self-aware and always probing. This is not, as the introduction notes, a memoir. Akin to Walter Benjamin's Berliner Kindheit um Neunzehnhundert (A Berlin Childhood in 1900), these essays intersect space and interiority, letting the reader discover a highly subjective and original reading of a world that is otherwise saturated by categories like The Muslim Woman and thus rendered un-intelligible.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have also been in Lahore for the last few weeks and headed back home (?) in a few days. Some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chapatimystery">snaps</a> are up on flickr. </p>
<p>In the meantime, there is much to share - and share I will. </p>
