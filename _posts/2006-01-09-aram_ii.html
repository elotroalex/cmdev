  content: I tried to search Mr. Aram's point of view on web but surprisingly found
    nothing. Why is he silent. I would like to know both sides of the story before
    promoting it on my blog. It may be some economic/managment issue in which hid
    counter part would have been involved. Or he might have shifted his business to
    cheaper place like china etc. I would wait for things to unfold. Any clues?

  content: MICHAEL ARAM IS VERY MUCH IN INDIA. HE MAKES CHINA WARES IN A CHINESE FACTORY
    ALL OTHER PRODUCTS ARE BEING SOURCED FROM FACTORIES IN MORADABAD IN INDIA AT THE
    CHEAPEST RATES WHERE NO LABOUR LAWS ARE OBSERVED. HE HAS PUT UP A SEPARATE FACTORY
    BY THE NAME OF MAD DESIGNS WHICH MEANS MICHAEL ARAM DESIGNS. IN THIS FACTORY MOST
    OF THE GOODS SOURCED ARE REPACKED AND SHOWN AS PRODUCED IN HOUSE . THIS FACTORY
    IS MEANT ONLY FOR SHOWING TO THE BUYERS WHO INSIST THAT PROPER LAWS OF THE LAND
    MUST BE OBSERVED.YOU WILL BE SURPRISED THAT NONE OF HIS MATERIAL IS TESTED TO
    COMPLY WITH LEAD CONTENTS AS PRESCRIBED BY FDA.HIS COUNTER PART FELL OUT WITH
    HIM WHEN HE DID NOT PAY HIM THE PROMISED SHARE. WHICH IS VERY NATURAL WITH THIS
    GENTLEMAN AND HE HAS DONE THIS TO MANY OTHER OF HIS PARTNERS BUT UNFORTUNATELY
    THIS TIME THE LABOUR GOT STUCK IN THE FIGHT AND POOR FELLOWS ARE SUFFERING.
