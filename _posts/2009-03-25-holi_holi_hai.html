<p>I failed to note holi here. But this <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2009/03/holi_the_festival_of_colors.html">set of big pictures</a> and a fortuitous scan (courtesy of Alam Sahib) gives me an excellent excuse to post this Mughal painting from 1625 and widely credited to Govardhan. It shows, first of all, the various activities associated with Holi. And I love the drunk Jahangir being carried to the bed. </p>
