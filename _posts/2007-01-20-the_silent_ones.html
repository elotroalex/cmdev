<p><i>Dink, who is survived by his wife, Rakel, and their three children, was charming, soft-spoken and eloquent. He was respected and beloved by many Turks who disagreed with his views but admired his courage in stating them.</p>
<p>He was hated by just as many. </i>[<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/19/AR2007011900453.html">via</a>]</p>
<p>When I wrote about Dink yesterday, I had written of the courage it takes to speak truth and the price one pays for it. I had written about how much of silly blogposts and dissertations we write lack that courage and that truth. I deleted those sentences because they sounded even more vacant and foolish than they seemed. After all, do I even have any truths? Last night, I rememebered what Faiz had said about people like me.</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<p><center></p>
<p><b>Love Carried Away It's Criminals In Bonded Feet</b></p>
<p>Wearing as their necklace, the hanging rope<br />
the singers kept on singing;<br />
Wrapping around the feet, the clanging chains<br />
the dancers kept on reveling;</p>
<p>We were neither in this procession, nor in that queue.<br />
We stood by the roadside, staring,<br />
being envious of them,<br />
and crying, silently.</p>
<p>When we returned, we found the color of the flowers<br />
once red, was yellow through and through.<br />
We checked ourselves to find<br />
instead of a heart, pain through and through.</p>
<p>Sometimes we imagined the iron ring around our neck.<br />
Sometimes the chain danced across our feet.</p>
<p>And then one day, Love, dragged us away,<br />
our neck in a rope and our feet in a chain,<br />
in the same caravan.<br />
As them.</center></p>
<p>Faiz Ahmed Faiz. Beirut, 1981. </p>
