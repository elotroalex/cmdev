<p><img src="/images/details.jpg" align="left" border="1" hspace=6>Details - The Most Irrelevant Magazine Ever - pissed off Asians in their April issue [full disclosure: in 1993, i had a Details subscription that lasted 8 months]. The culprit was a Gay or Asian? style guide featuring a metrosexual (!) oriental and blurbs like "A bonsai ass requires delicate tending". Indeed.<br />
Needless to say, the East Asian community <a href="http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2004/04/16/protest_details.php"> protested</a> their metallic snickers off in front of the Details office yesterday.<br />
All this is barely amusing and i only have a couple of incidental observations. First, what happened to us south asians? how come we haven't cracked the Habib-gas-attendant and Patel-KnightsInn-clerk glass ceiling? When can we be cool enough to be slurred wearing $400 jeans and Dolce&Gabbana Suede Jackets ("Keeps the last samurai warm and buttoned tight on the battlefield").<br />
I would love to go protest such injustice in manhattan.<br />
Secondly, as gerry would attest, I use with glee the 18th and 19th century descriptions of the Asian races (wily chinee, crafty hindoo, savage mohammadin) and in that regard i appreciate Details trying to put a 21st century spin on it.<br />
I insist that future posts in Details should include "Terrorist or Paki?" and "JobStealer or Bharati?" as well as hard-hittin' investigative pieces such as "Curry: The Thais stole it from the Indians" and "Queer Eye for the Mullah".<br />
hmmm...maybe I should work on these myself.</p>
