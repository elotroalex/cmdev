<p>Gentle Readers,</p>
<p>It has been a while since we last spoke and much has happened-- good and notgood-- and I have been remiss with my absence. In a few short weeks you will be able to buy my book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Conquest-Chachnama-Muslim-Origins/dp/0674660110/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1470885628&sr=8-1&keywords=a+book+of+conquest+manan" target="_blank">A Book of Conquest</a></em> from your online or retail bookseller in US, EU and South Asia.</p>

<p>&mdash; A Book of Conquest (@bookofconquest) <a href="https://twitter.com/bookofconquest/status/763553004352069632">August 11, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>I finished writing the book in earnest last August (2015) and submitted it to the Press. It took until around May for copy-editing and indexing and other things to get set-- and almost exactly a year to the date, I have the physical book in my hand. That feels amazing (and actually it is amazing given usual publication schedules are 18 months).</p>
<p>What can I say about the book: It is mostly the history of a Persian text, <em>Chachnama</em> which was written around 1220s. It is mostly a history of the region of Sind from the 9th to the 13th century. It is mostly about a political theory that existed before the Mughals and about which we know little (in general). It is mostly about the notion that Muslims are outsiders to South Asia. It is mostly about how we seek answers in origins (wrongly). It is mostly about a method of doing history as post-partitioned subjects. It is mostly what I wanted to say and I am glad that I was able to say it and I am grateful that you will be able to read it.</p>
<p>I was planning on writing some short posts about the mechanics of the book writing and publishing and whatever I learned from it. I say "was" mainly because I am drowning in other writing assignments and classes are about to start so I don't know how/when I will get to it. Yet, it is a priority and I will.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, this note is meant to say:</p>
<p>There will be some more book-related news in the next few months.</p>
