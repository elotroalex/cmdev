<p>I have been reading the <a href="www.gothamist.com">Gothamist</a> for absolutely no reason [i don't live in NY, duh] but I like the blog and always thought that there should be a Chicago version. Now, <a href="http://www.kottke.org"> Kottke</a> tells us that there is a Beta version out for Chicago called <a href="http://www.chicagoist.com">Chicagoist</a>! And they even like <a href="http://www.chicagoist.com/archives/2004/05/18/chicago_in_1904.php">History!!</a><br />
The name, however, is not good and does not conform to the template. Gotham is not NY's name. How about WindyCitist? BigShoulderist? SecondCityist? Loopist? EList? StuffedPizzaist? Bluesist?<br />
And Gerry wins the Name Game with The Daleyist&Atilde;&dagger;<br />
Anyways, looking forward to this one.</p>
