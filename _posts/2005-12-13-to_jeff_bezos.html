<p>Dear Jeff,</p>
<p>I am a long-term Amazon.com customer and someone very appreciative of the efforts of Amazon.com in times of national and International emergencies to mobilize aid. I send a hopeful note when the earthquake hit South Asia, to your address, wishing that Amazon.com can help in the relief gathering efforts as it did in the case of Tsunami and Katrina. </p>
<p>I am trying once again and urging my friends and colleagues to ask you as well. The conditions are still dire. We really need to mobilize our networks, social and other, to save millions of lives.</p>
<p>I hope that Amazon can help the victims of South Asia by directing traffic to Red Cross International or to UN relief agencies working in Kashmir. </p>
<p>sincerely,</p>
<p>m.</p>

Thanks to the fine people at saquake.org.</p>
