<p>We have seen all four in action now. I am a tad <a href="/archives/straw_polls/the_tipping_point.html">invested</a> in these debates. I wanted to watch the first two before opining anything out loud. Mainly, because I didn't want to jinx it.</p>
<p>Basically, I am convinced that a house built of straws just needs a huffnpuff - not a hurricane. The emperor has no clothes. This administration has consistently and constantly lied. The media clammed and moved into a corner. Our Fearless Leader has never been challenged. Not once. On what he did and why he did it or to justify how he did it. He has held only around a dozen solo press conferences with pre-screened Q&A in the last four years. The entire Iraq war, education policy, health care, nuclear proliferation have been pre-packaged and sold "debates" to the public; talk about manufacturing consent. All because America was attacked on 9/11 and we cannot be unpatriotic and question the administration. </p>
<p>The debates were going to be the only place that someone would get in their face and challenge them. And they did. Kerry did it on Thursday and Edwards last night.<br />

That is what Bush looks like when someone questions him. </center></p>

That is what Cheney looks like when someone repeatedly says Halliburton.</center></p>
<p>These are flustered, angry faces of people who have not heard NO in 3 years. They have not heard WHY in 3 years and they have not heard "Mr. Vice President, there is no connection between the attacks of September 11th and Saddam Hussein." It's about time they did.</p>
