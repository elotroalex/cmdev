<p>Kill the <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1151203/militant-siege-of-peshawar-school-ends-141-killed">future</a><br />
Shut down twitter, facebook, linkedin, google<br />
Unplug the internet, the hydro-dam, the nuclear reactor<br />
Shutter the few generators of electricity<br />
let those hooked to machines, die</p>
<p>Spray with fire our books; plug the holes in our logic with bullets. Erect a flag, on a bamboo stick. Plant it in the father's chest. </p>
<p>Tear the scream from the mother's throat tune it to the national anthem set the reverbs of the blasts as rhythms release it for us to Like</p>
<p>Pour gasoline on me,<br />
Flick your thumb against the flint<br />
Light me.<br />
Make me watch how I burn and then shoot me<br />
shoot me<br />
shoot me<br />
shoot me<br />
shoot me<br />
shoot me until 132 bodies are full of your lead.<br />
shoot me in the eyes.</p>
<p>Write my obituary<br />
Find out who fought for my cause<br />
Make of them Heroes of Islam<br />
Garland them in poppies.<br />
Let them smoke my ashes. </p>
<p>wear your uniform to my funeral, have your dharna at my door, make your reconciliation, enjoy your appeasement, drone me, fill my shed skin with petro-dollars, sing me a hindu lullaby. </p>
<p>murder the past, kill the future. </p>
