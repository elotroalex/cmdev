<p>Or Nobody! Ha!</p>
<p>Anyways, before the great proletariat revolution consumes us all, I wanted to tip the hat towards Matt Taibbi's breathless putdown of this Palinesque exurbia, <a href="http://www.smirkingchimp.com/thread/17504">The scariest thing about Sarah Palin isn't how unqualified she is - it's what her candidacy says about America</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In her speech, Palin presented herself as a raging baby-making furnace of middle-class ambition next to whom the yuppies of the Obama set -who never want anything all that badly except maybe a few afternoons with someone else's wife, or a few kind words in&Acirc;&nbsp;<em>The New York Times Book Review</em>&Acirc;&nbsp;-- seem like weak, self-doubting celibates, the kind of people who certainly cannot be trusted to believe in the right God or to defend a nation.&Acirc;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>It is a classic.</p>
