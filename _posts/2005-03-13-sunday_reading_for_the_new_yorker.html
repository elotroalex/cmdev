    I know what you mean about the pile of New Yorkers.  Does reading the cartoons and the jazz listings authorize me to consider an issue "done"?

    Yes, I think it does.

  content: You are looking for a job & still planning to keep up with the New Yorker?
    Go head with your bad academic self! I miss the New Yorker because I can`t buy
    it in the Japanese countryside. I haven`t read the Sunday New York Times & Washington
    Post (online) because I`m addicted to reading blogs, yours included.

    Caleb: You reminded me of this guy they profiled in the <i>NYT</i> a few years ago. This gentleman read <i>every</i> word of the NYT daily. Except he was like 4 years behind. So, he was reading, daily, a NYT from four years ago - all yellowed out - surrounded in his apartment with heaps upon heaps of the daily.
    Ms.World: <i>Thank you</i> for reading. And I am sure that the Japanese countryside over-compensates for missing the New Yorker.

  content: "all i can say [rounda]bout nuruddin farah is: reading _maps_ in a lit
    class of midwestern students falling into two categories: the bright-eyedly earnest
    or the joint-atrophied (is the brain a joint, as is the mouth??), either from
    affectation or organised sports, is one of the most anachronistic experiences.
    ever. conversation never fails to drift into how the assigned section was *just*
    like that movie.... \nfarah's style is sometimes gratingly overt (symbolism, especially),
    such that it's hard to enjoy on either immediate aesthetic or contemplative/theoretical
    level. much is, apparently, made of his \"feminism,\" solely on his writing from
    the perspective of female characters. surely all involved can do better.\naccessibility
    of african literature is a glaring problem, as much reading thereof becomes a
    token glance taken as, for example, The Somali Experience."

    <strong>Go eat some yummy chapati!</strong>

    I was never a big fan of Chapati - except when made by my nani-ma rolled up with sugar and ghee.  Umm Yummy! Now there is a good blog which is like nani-ma's chapati for the brain.  Go get your daily dose!

<p><img src="/img/sunday.jpg" align=left hspace=22 vspace=6>I am starting to hate the <i>New Yorker</i>. I am weeks behind. They pile up, mercilessly mocking my inability to read them. Do I need this pressure in my life? And people ask me whether I read this or that. I will soon, I say. All <s>Cretans</s> Pakistanis are liars. </p>
<ul>
<li>All that to draw your attention to one of the best things I have read in a long while. Jim Holt's <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/printable/?critics/050228crat_atlarge">Time Bandit</a> which appeared a few weeks ago in the <i>New Yorker</i>. It is about the friendship between Einstein and G&Atilde;&euro;&Atilde;&oelig;del. "Time, like God, is either necessary or nothing; if it disappears in one possible universe, it is undermined in every possible universe, including our own." That alone was enough to give me dreams for days. In my previous life, I was an incredible physics geek. It was good to revisit that past. Also, maybe Ralph can tell us what G&Atilde;&euro;&Atilde;&oelig;del was referring to as the "'inconsistency' in the Constitution, one that could allow a dictatorship to arise". I have had the morbid thought that Bushites will try to repeal the 22nd Amendment.
<li>In the <i>Guardian</i>, is an <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,1435601,00.html">extract</a> from Orhan Pamuk's <i>Istanbul</i>. I am assuming y'all read the Pamuk piece, <i>The Pamuk Apartments</i> in the <i>New Yorker</i>?
<li>Also in the <i>Guardian</i> is a <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/history/0,6121,1436277,00.html">review</a> of Nicholas Ostler's <i>Empires of the Word: A Language History of the World</i> by Jane Stevenson. The book asks why languages survive and dominate while others die. It appears that bureaucracy is good for something after all. Will English continue to dominate forever? Ha! Try Spanglish. Singlish. Chinglish. Engrish. And of course, 1337. Paging Sam Huntington.
<li>Someone who did appreciate bureaucracy was Franz Kafka. I find it Kafkaesque that in recent historiography he seems to be making the move from a person to a place. <i>TLS</i>renders the problems for some recent <a href="http://www.the-tls.co.uk/this_week/story.aspx?story_id=2110191">biographies</a>.
<li>The <i>Independent</i> has a profile of <a href="http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/books/interviews/story.jsp?story=618756">Nuruddin Farah</a> and his upcoming trilogy of novels on Mogadishu. I have not read anything by Farah but I will rectify that soon enough.
<li>From Mogadishu to America. And the <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2005/03/13/re_branding_america?pg=full">Re-branding</a> of said nation profiled in the <i>Boston Globe</i>.
<li>Finally <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/17850">Clifford Geertz</a> takes on two recent doomsday books in the <i>NY Review of Books</i>. To Geertz, both Jared Diamond and Richard Posner's view of human behavior is "sociologically thin and ... lacking in psychological depth". This should be read in conjunction with Adam Gopnik's excellent piece, yes...in the <i>New Yorker</i>, on <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/critics/books/index.ssf?050307crbo_books">Voltaire</a>. </ul>
