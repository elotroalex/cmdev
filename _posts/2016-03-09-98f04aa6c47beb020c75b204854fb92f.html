<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I work at Cambridge University Press and was wondering if I may request you to feature one of our titles- Communal Violence, Forced Migration and the State: Gujarat since 2002 (author- Sanjeevini Badigar Lokhande) in your XQs series.<br />
Here is the link to the book- http://www.cambridge.org/fm/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/south-asian-government-politics-and-policy/communal-violence-forced-migration-and-state-gujarat-2002?format=HB<br />
(It is already published in India and is due to be published in the UK and US next month)</p>
<p>I'll be glad if this would be of interest to you. </p>
<p>Best wishes,<br />
Anwesha<br />
