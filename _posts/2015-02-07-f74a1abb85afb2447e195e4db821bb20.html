<p>Hi! My name is Isra Ansari, I work as an Assistant Fiction Editor at The Missing Slate, on online Arts and Literature magazine.</p>
<p>The magazine was founded in Pakistan, but it is actually a 'border-less' magazine, our team is from all over the world. We publish a wide array of literature and I would be really interested in soliciting work from the authors of CM, I believe it would be a great fit for TMS! </p>
<p>Hope to hear from you soon!</p>
