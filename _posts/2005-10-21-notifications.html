    I'm definately down to help with a one day donation drive.  I think all the south asian affiliated television shows (zee tv, mtv, desitelevision), newspapers, Diwali/Eid celebrations, blogs should all try to coordinate.  I know I may be too idealistic, but if we don't try, we won't know.

    Also, I think its a great opportunity for communities that have held on to historical issues can begin collaborating on small fronts.  Just my two cents.  And I am very willing to work, meet, donate my time and energy to this.

    Peace.

<p>I am going to have a weekend in Vermont, looking at the night sky. Then, I will be in Boston for the next week, attending some this or that. Any readers in the Hahvahd area, drop an email for a hail fellow, well met routine. I am good at those things. </p>
<p>Posts will follow as opportunity presents itself. </p>
<p>The drive for earthquake relief continues. </p>
<p>Please make some posters asking for donation of goods and money. If you write good prose, or have worked in fundraising, we can use some a substantial written plea. Please email that to me and I can forward it around, as well as post it. There are two such emails already submitted. I am creating a separate <a href="pleas.html">page</a> with them. If you have any such email/web action, please email me and I will add to the list. </p>
<p>A unified blog donation day coupled with a campaign to write Letters to the Editors, Senators and Congress is what I am proposing. How about November 8th? That will be the month anniversary. Thoughts?</p>
<p>And I fucked up the date on the Desis Sans Frontieres. I am so sorry. Email me and we can fix this. Damn it.</p>
