<p><img src="/images/CHWrite.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>This short week was waaay too long. I am stuck. Not in a writer's block but a reader's block. I don't feel like reading anything. I have to finish translating parts of this hyper-stylized persian manuscript but I haven't looked at it. I have to send an abstract to someone kind enough to actually solicit an article from me for an edited volume and I haven't done it. I have to write a syllabus and I haven't wanted to bother. It's not laziness. I spend all day at work troubleshooting some Filemaker bizarro and troubleshooting a WordPress install and troubleshooting my flagging interest. </p>
<p>The abstract must be written this weekend.<br />
I am also seriously considering jumping to <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> except I cannot figure out why my htaccess file keeps bringing the server down. The url need to be pretty (non-PHP) and I have to have a redirect for the few kind souls who linked to various posts I have written here. I think I will try it over the weekend because Movable Type is getting <i>really</i> lethargic on me. I thought about going to MT 3.0 (any users reading this? chime in). So, come Monday, this all might just be broken.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Marlowe has opened up a can of whupass on the <a href="http://defeasiblefee.blogspot.com/2004/07/renaissance-when-part-i-why.html">State of American Politics</a>. Please go read it. He is a smart cookie - that one. </p>
<p>Also, I am thinking of starting <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/afghanistan/story/0,1284,1257512,00.html">my own private prison</a>. I promise shag carpet, best Cairo sheesha and back issues of The Nation. </p>
<p>So, gentle reader, have a great weekend.</p>
