<p>I just stumbled on the tribute to lloyd and sue.  I knew then in 1964-65-66 first at Harvard , then at chicago and then, through lots of advice I get from Sue: baby sitters and careers (she had her son while we were in chicago. They would come and have dinner at our apartment. We - my room mate and I were there at the Kenwood house for cheese, cracker thins and indian food many many times.<br />
I wish I had attended the vermont memorial - did not know about it.  But, whoever you are, your tribute is brilliant and witty.  Sue would have loved it.  Lloyd even more.   Nirmala (202 288 9810)<br />
