<p><img src="/img/sunday.jpg" align=left hspace=22 vspace=6>It is a tad on the chilly side here in Chicago and, for some unknown reason, I woke up around 9:30. Sunday is the day I sleep in. If I don't hit noon, I feel shortchanged. Oh well. I guess, I can have breakfast, no? It is all doom and gloom in the news as usual. One sunday, I will post only happy news. </p>
<ul>
<li>Chicago Tribune continues its excellent Sunday series in <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0410030437oct03,1,1593505.story?coll=chi-news-hed">Killing in the Name of God</a>. It is a profile of Ismail Maasawabi, a suicide-bomber which dwells into the social fabric of Gaza City.
<li>From Jang Daily comes a <a href="http://www.jang.com.pk/jang/oct2004-daily/03-10-2004/editorial/col8.htm">reply</a> from a religious scholar on the question of suicide bombings, jihad and insurrections. I won't translate it for my non-Urdu readers because it is sunday and I am lazy. The gist is that the maulana is tired of being the scapegoat and says why don't you look to the state instead of religion to understand jihadists? A valid point, in my humble opinion.
<li>In the LRB, Adam Shatz <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n19/shat01_.html">profiles</a> the French-Algerian author Yasmina Khadra - a pseudonym for Mohammed Moulessehoul, a former Algerian military officer. I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1902881117/qid=1096821427/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-1778845-6583817?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">In the Name of God</a> - his novel about a jihadist in a small village in Algeria - and didn't know what to make of it. This essay contextualizes the author in the forever widening ripples from the Algerian civil war. Things to ponder here.
<li>Max Rodenbeck in NY Review of Books takes on the <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/17477"> House of Saud</a>. Faith and state have provided the deadly molotov cocktail in the Arabian peninsula. But, hey! they have oil. This is a good one-stop-shop on the Saudis. Though, I must say that these expos&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&nbsp;s are getting oh-so-early 90s.
<li>Frank Rich in the NYT, is trying his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/03/arts/03rich.html?8hpib=&oref=login&pagewanted=all&position=">damndest</a> to give O'Reilly an aneurysm.
<li>Lastly, here is our <a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2004/October/middleeast_October66.xml&section=middleeast">latest</a> portent of doom.
<li>PS: Stating the obvious, but everyone must read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/03/international/middleeast/03tube.html?ei=1&en=c8b1d940a7b425cc&ex=1097746395&pagewanted=all&position=?NYT_REG_SYSTEM_IS_A_POX_ON_DECENCY">this</a>.</ul>
