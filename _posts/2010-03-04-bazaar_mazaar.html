<p>I really want <a href="http://www.oup.com.pk/shopexd.asp?id=1623">this book</a>. CM readers in Lahore/Karachi, with access to a post office and a paypal account, I am looking at you. </p>
<p>From Huma Yusuf's review in <a href="http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/culture/03-the-visual-culture-ss-02">Dawn.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Readers will enjoy flipping through old advertisements as well as gathering tidbits about brands that they've always consumed, but perhaps never really known.</p>
<p>That said, serendipitous finds &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; essays on artifacts and practices one didn't expect in a volume on Pakistani visual culture &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; are amongst the most engrossing. Michel Boivin's 'Horsemen and Saviours: Iconography in Hindu Communities of 20th Century Sindh' considers the role of the horseman in Hindu visual narratives; Malcolm Hutcheson and Atteqa Ali's 'Rooh Keench: Backdrops for Photography' deconstructs the escapist backdrops for portrait photography; Aasim Akhtar's 'The Mace and the Sceptre: Iconography in Pehelwan (Wrestler) Posters' evokes the fascinating sub-culture of wrestling; and Fancisco Jos&Atilde;&copy; Luis's 'Guru Nanak Shah Faqir: Sufi and Shia Elements in the Representation of Guru Nanak' offers a detailed analysis of a mid-19th century portrait of the Sikh guru.</p>
