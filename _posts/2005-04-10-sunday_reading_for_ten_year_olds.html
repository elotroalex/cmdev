<p><img class="graphic" src="/images/sunday.jpg">Who has been eating my porridge? While I was having a fairly busy weekend, CM exploded with posts. And brilliant ones at that. I feel like Jeff Van Gundy clinging to Alonzo Mourning's leg. All I have are some feeble links:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am torn about the <a href="http://www.ratio3.org/kahlon_3.htm">art</a> of Rajkamal Kahlon. The Orientalist histories of India come in for some amazing re-imaginings but ... the sanctity of the text! [my UC soul screams]
<li>Another amazing text is Samuel Johnson's <i>Dictionary</i>. Can you imagine the <i>cojones</i> of this man? The <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml;sessionid=CCRFKVDRAOQBVQFIQMGSNAGAVCBQWJVC?xml=/arts/2005/04/03/bohit03.xml&sSheet=/arts/2005/04/03/botop.html&secureRefresh=true&_requestid=48729">review</a> in the <i>Telegraph</i> of Henry Hitchings' book notes that Johnson wrote "all the definitions (42,773 of them), he also ransacked whole libraries to find 110,000 quotations with which to illustrate them". Wiki, dude.
<li>Max Rodenbeck tackles <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/17952">Lebanon</a> in the <i>NY Review of Books</i>. He writes about the tension between Pan-Arab [Syria] and nationalist sentiments in Lebanon ["That fear is now largely gone"].
<li>Two books grabbed my attention last week. First up was Alicia Erian's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/10/books/review/10GILESL.html?oref=login&pagewanted=all&position=">Towelhead</a>. In a Salon <a href="http://www.salon.com/books/int/2005/04/02/erian/index_np.html">interview</a>, she had some very interesting things to say about being a writer and selling a book as the "other" in demand after 9/11. I am unsure as to her politics and the interview left more questions. The second was <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1454031,00.html">this</a> book by the "post-post-post-colonialist" Rattawut Lapcharoensap. The review in the <i>Guardian</i> has perhaps the zaniest line of any review: "There is a risk that a writer like Lapcharoensap will be well-reviewed on the nod, tapping in as he does to reviewer-friendly political correctness, but will fail to find an audience among book buyers wary of octosyllabic names." Also, dear farangi, why is the Thai slang for foreigners, farang?
<li>Lastly, can anyone remember <a href="http://www.harryflashman.org/flashypapers.htm">Flashman</a>? If not, you missed out. Fake history never read so good. The nice <a href="http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/books/features/story.jsp?story=628173">recap</a> in the <i>Independent</i> brought some memories.</ul>
