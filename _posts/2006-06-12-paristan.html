    OK, first off my math skills suck, so your verification thing required the opening of Calculator in Windows.



    Secondly, I'd have gone with "Abhay oye, kutti!" (or kutiya, depending on how proper I felt).



    Thirdly, the FUCK?  I want my mother to watch this.

    I concur w/ Sin: Oye Kuttiya! would be my translation of Hey Bitch. Churail is an interesting choice, I dig. But not accurate.



    Also, sorry about the math, Sin. Trying to keep them spambots in check. Anyways, as a Barrister, you will be counting money plenty :)

    Ah Yes, YouTube.



    Thanks Zack.



    Here is the whole episode <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2aGiifuxcI" rel="nofollow">in</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxBWUePxLQ0" rel="nofollow">three</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj9Mq_N8YHk" rel="nofollow">sections</a> ... Paris prayin' in the last segment is something I really didn't need to see.

<p><a href="http://www.eonline.com/On/SimpleLife4/Episodes/episode2.html#">Paris and Nicole trade in their designer dresses for traditional saris when they take over the responsibilities of a traditional Pakistani mom. With the patient help of their "husband" and Americanized fifteen-year-old "son," the girls manage to dress, speak and dance like conservative Pakistani housewives</a>... the mind, it boggles.</p>
