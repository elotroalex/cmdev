  content: 'hey o: pretty disgusting, if you ask me. i have been following it like
    everyone else. Most absurd factoid: UCLA''s chancellor has a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anti-Terrorism-Criminal-Enforcement-Supplement-Seminars/dp/0314159304/sr=1-1/qid=1164079661/ref=sr_1_1/002-5413297-3001667?ie=UTF8&s=books"
    rel="nofollow">Anti-Terrorism and Criminal Enforcement</a>. Slightly less absurd
    factoid: My uncle who lives in LV co-owns the company that supplies most Taser
    guns to the West Coast. Dunno if either facts are relevant.'

  content: Fascinating about Abrams's book.  Had no idea.  Now I've learned how to
    spell "Tazer".

Hadley, conceded that the president had not come into direct contact with ordinary Vietnamese, but said that they connected anyway.</p>
<p>&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&ordm;If you&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;d been part of the president&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;s motorcade as we&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;ve shuttled back and forth,&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&sup1; he said, reporters would have seen that &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&ordm;the president has been doing a lot of waving and getting a lot of waving and smiles.&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&sup1;</a></p>
<p>Only the Chosen One can avoid people in Asia - perhaps, an even more quixotic mission than the one in Iraq.</p>
<p>Also, see Lady Bush check out a <a href="http://editorial.gettyimages.com/source/search/details_pop.aspx?iid=72579287&cdi=0">"old book"</a> in Singapore. Doesn't look too old from the binding and does look like a Qur'an.</p>
