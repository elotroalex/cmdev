<p>I need to sell my laptop and my desktop G4s. I keep meaning to put them on marketplace but I forget. In the meantime, dust is accumulating in the giga-flopping chipsets.<br />
Of course, I am selling them to clear room for the G5 powerbook. Oh yeah. Let me tell you as a registered Apple Developer that nothing will be hotter than the G5 PB. Nothing. My G5 desktop (dual 1.8GHz/1G RAM) needs 7 fans to cool it off as it applies my latest Fill Tab command in Office X.<br />
The PB will then either need to be operated entirely inside a Coke vending machine OR it will come with it's own portable Industrial Strength Cooling Fan 2000XD-L. Either way, I am psyched.<br />
What about the rumors of a <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=167"><em>liquid-cooling system</em></a>? Well, I happen to know the inside track there as well. The liquid-cooling system is fully operational and tested. It works great. The only hitch left to solve is to keep the water from spilling when you tilt the powerbook. They are working on that. There are also efforts to do something like the original iMacs (with colors) by doing a branding tie-in with Gatorade to cool the machines.<br />
The ingenuity of Apple engineers (should they be called Macineers? like Imagineers of Disney) knows no bound though. They know that in hot climates, when people wanna stay cool, they put loose, meshed clothes that keep the body temperature down. So, along with liquid-cooling, they are <a href="http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/cultofmac/index.blog?entry_id=292196"><em>clothing</em></a> the new G5 PB in mesh. Maybe they can do tie-in's with Gatorade AND Banana Republic!<br />
I cannot wait.<br />
