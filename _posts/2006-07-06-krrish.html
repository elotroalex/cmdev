  content: I agree with Adil, but the D. film is probably Jugnu. Businessman by day,
    firefly(-by-night) Robin-hood burglar type. Also a voice that carried, since didn't
    he sing "pyar ke is khel mein do dilon ke mel mein" from a helicopter to Hema
    Malini on the ground in the film?

  content: Nah, its not jugnu that I am thinking of [though, I fondly remember that
    one]..it had D. dead/almost dead at the ultimate showdown inside the temple and
    then, the godhead comes alive and inhabits him and he becomes the Vengeance. Eyes
    all flipped and shit. Pretty Rad. Almost as rad as singing from the helicopter.

  content: The real Indian superman I guess remains the Amitabh clone Mukesh Khanna
    in the TV serial <a xhref="http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/s/shakti.htm">Shaktimaan</a>
    (aka Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnathnath Shastri). Shaktimaan is
    also much stronger than Superman. For one thing, he has yogic powers.

    Krrish is the copy of TWO movies &amp; infact this 2 movies are far far better than krrish &amp; worth watching.

    Kung Fu Hustle + Paycheck = Krrish

<p>"<i>His special powers are modest by western standards, though spectacular enough by local standards.</i>" Don't really know what to say about that, but <a href="http://www.henryjenkins.org/2006/07/truth_justice_and_the_south_as.html">here</a> is a review of 'the first superhero movie' from India. Of course we know that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0297416/">Superman</a> is the first Indian superhero movie. Also, didn't Dharmendra have a series of movies, in early 80s, where he would get 'superpowers' for his climactic fight? Anyone? </p>
<p><b>update:</b> Also, see the Turkish superheroes<a href="http://www.i-mockery.com/minimocks/3devadam/">3 Dev Adam</a>!</p>
