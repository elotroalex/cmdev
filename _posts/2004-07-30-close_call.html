    Isn't it 'haram' to kill anybody, Muslim or Not?  Suicide bombers should not be considered Muslims.  It should become clear now that this isn't about religion at all.

<p>I was gonna stay away today - recuperating from last night's Kerrymania. Yet, the world rudely intervened. Yesterday, a suicide bomber <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3940723.stm">attempted</a> to assassinate PM-designate Shaukat Aziz. He was campaigning in Fath Jang in the Attock district for the August 18th election. 6 people were killed in the attack. Shaukat Aziz escaped unhurt.<br />
I hate for either Musharraf or Aziz to be the Franz Ferdinand of the 21st century. No, it is not alarmist talk. Musharraf IS a military dictator. I hate military dictators. Shaukat Aziz is an "appointed" PM with close ties to the Bush Administration. But we do not need either of them getting assassinated. That is a geo-political crisis Pakistan cannot deal with on any level. And an unstable Pakistan next to a turbulent Afghanistan next to the axis-of-convenience Iran cannot spell but D-O-O-M.<br />
There have been repeated attempts on Musharraf's life. Some publicized some not so much. Some came very, very close. Various jihadists are determined to take him out. I really hope that they never succeed.<br />
I am retreating into medieval textual world for a few days. Have a safe weekend, everyone. (Is the <i>Manchurian Candidate</i> medieval entertainment?)</p>
