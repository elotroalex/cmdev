    i agree on the hot and humid.  oddly enough "rita" thought the weather was beautiful.  gross.

    i have you beat with a machine yesterday that had 47 critical updates.

    and im still mad that you didnt grab me a hotdog yesterday.  but forgave you for letting me use the umbrella.

<p>It is HOT and HUMID! Yesterday, it was cold. why? What happened to spring in Chicago? Can I have a clear blue sky? Please!?<br />
Today, I have had to deal with Sasser happiness, Eudora upgrades, and general technological malaise. Our licensing department sees fit to put a download link to Eudora 6 on a page clearly titled Eudora 5. Oh.Okay.<br />
Furthermore, the user had 34 critical updates for her machine. She had been dismissing the "YOU HAVE CRITICAL UPDATES. INSTALL NOW??" dialogues. Didn't think they were needed.</p>
<p>Plus, I have to write the lecture for today's class. Actually, I can use Tuesday's lecture since I never got around to it. I also have to give them a mid-term evaluation - of me. scared to hear those verdicts.</p>
<p>On the bright side - we got Herman Miller's Aereon chair knock-offs for my office. Plus, there is cricket on the quads.</p>
