    etc. for fellow coconut-hair-oil/shine deprived folks?

<p><a href="http://www.thebodyshop.com/bodyshop/index.jsp">The Body Shop</a> has no regard for desis. None. Here is a letter written, with unkempt hair, by one dear friend of mine. He may not want me to publish it on CM, but I think it needs to be. I think that The Body Shop needs to know what they are doing to their customers. </p>

<div id ="blockquoted">
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>I am writing to register my most vehement objection to your decision to</p>
<p>discontinue the sale of <a href="http://www.uk.thebodyshop.com/web/tbsuk/indexTiles.jsp?tbsmain=products_overview&curr_category=TBSUK_hair&subcatID=TBSUK_hc_new_styling">Coconut Hair Shine</a>.  My wife and I have both been Body</p>
<p>Shop customers, off and on, for over 15 years now, and have tried many, many of</p>
<p>your products.  But the one thing that has always been sure to bring us back into</p>
<p>the store was the Hair Shine, which both of us have used daily over this entire</p>
<p>period.  </p>
<p>Had we known that you were going to discontinue it, we would have stocked up! </p>
<p>Indeed, even now we are trying to get friends to bring us some Hair Shine from</p>
<p>England, where it is apparently still available in stores.  </p>
<p>I have no idea what circumstances led you to take this drastic step, and thereby</p>
<p>deprive my wife and I of practically the only hair product that we have used</p>
<p>consistently during our entire adult lives.  But unless the production of Coconut</p>
<p>Hair Shine was somehow exerting undue stress on the ozone layer, or depleting the</p>
<p>Pacific Salmon population, or driving up the price of a gallon of milk, or</p>
<p>contributing to Iran's nuclear ambitions...or at least SOMETHING important, then</p>
<p>WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN THINKING????</p>
<p>Please, please, please bring back the Hair Shine.  Until you do, I, for one, won't</p>
<p>likely be back to the Body Shop anytime soon.  </p>
<p>Sincerely yours.</p></div>
