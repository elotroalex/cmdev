  content: Well, Google didn't fail at all actually. It pointed to the right person.
    In Knowledge Management speak, the system worked well as an "Expert locator" finding
    the right document and pointing to the "Expert" who might be able to help  based
    on the available documents. Good eh?

<p>A sweet old lady in the UK did a search on google: "pakistani man marrying british woman what are his right of remaining in uk". My blog was # 3 - first two being a canadian royal site and wikipedia entry on Pakistan. She emailed me asking for help navigating British Immigration channels.<br />
So, I did some googling of my own and found an <a href="http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/default.asp?pageID=106">answer</a> and emailed it to her.<br />
I was gonna make a smartyass comment about google failing her...but it didn't. Google karmically gave her exactly the right link.<br />
Isn't love grand?</p>
