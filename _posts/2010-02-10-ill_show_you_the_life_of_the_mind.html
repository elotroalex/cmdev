  content: Ok, the wiki page for Barton Fink <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barton_Fink>
    is proof positive that grad schools should not exist. We go back to apprenticeships!

  content: I'd like to see someone do a study on how much content on the wikipedia
    is supplied by un(der)employed ABD/PhD types. That might make a good dissertation
    topic. Anyone?

I've been trying to figure out what exactly the motivation for the lie is. Is it exploitative? (if we don't have graduate students, we will have to teach Intro to Whatever Studies ourselves!) Evil? (let's take bright, na&Atilde;&macr;ve young people full of hope, run them through the meat grinder and see what comes out the other side!) Lazy? (I don't know what she's going to do with a PhD in medieval Hungarian ballads, but I'm sure she'll think of something) Ignorant? (there's a shortage of tenure-track jobs?) Denial-filled? (the job market is sure to improve!)</p>
