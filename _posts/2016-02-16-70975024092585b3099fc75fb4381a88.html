<p>Dear Team Chapati Mystery,</p>
<p>This is in response to your &ldquo;Statement of Solidarity with Student Protests in India, from students of the University of Chicago&rdquo;.<br />
When you &ldquo;strongly condemned the arbitrary, unconstitutional, and anti-democratic actions of the BJP/RSS/ABVP/Delhi Police continuum at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus&rdquo; you forgot to mention another Party which is stunned to witness such a demonstration. &ldquo;The party&rdquo; is the common Indian citizen that is left stunned hearing Anti-India slogans praising and sympathising a terrorist, Afzal Guru, who confessed his interview to a private news agency. The slogans also were directed towards freedom of Kashmir from Indian occupancy and we also learnt that Kerela and West Bangal is also under &ldquo;Indian occupancy&rdquo; now and demands its freedom. Let me start by I assuring you that I have no formal affiliation with any of the above mentioned agencies and by appreciating your concern in the matter of India, Indian politics, social/political reforms etc.<br />
First of all I failed to understand your right to &ldquo;demand&rdquo; in the context. By practicing what right are you in a position to &ldquo;demand&rdquo; here? A Request? Yes, that you may by all means. By the way, who was this letter of solidarity was addressed to? The ruling Government or any official? Well then you need to be made aware of a certain protocol that needs to be followed when you address any government of any country with certain salutations. Would you write the same way to the Dean of your University? So in the name of basic courtesy and courtesy and etiquette kindly do use appropriate salutations. And in absence of a proper address, your letter is vague as your knowledge of the stated event and the events that has led to it.<br />
In your letter you said that &ldquo;the ABVP was involved in raising the controversial slogans that are being cited to justify the sedition charge&rdquo;? If you go through the video in the link below and you will know when ABVP enter the demonstration and what their slogans were all about. The evidence is right before you're here.<br />

That being said, when you claimed that the &ldquo;Indian political program imagines the citizen as upper caste, heterosexual, male, Hindu; and is against the Muslim, the Dalit, the Left.&rdquo; You, I believe will be please to know that our Prime Minister belongs to OBC caste and not even a week ago the same brigade of students protested in front of RSS' head office in Delhi and called our Prime Minister a &ldquo;Bhaduwa &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; A pimp&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dalla &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; A pimp&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bhangi &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; a Dalit&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bhangi ki aulaad &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Son of a dalit&rdquo; and a lot more. If you talk about &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo;, no sedation charges were imposed upon the students then and no common public even took the matter in their own hands. The authority dispersed the crowd with a light lathi charge.  And for your information, addressing someone as &ldquo;a bhangi&rdquo; is a non bailable offence in India as per the Indian Penal Code. We TOLERATED that, everybody did. I apologize the use of the above words, they certainly oppose my sensitivity but I had to bring the matter to your attention. Anyway, when all that failed to provoke the Government, and Authority, the JNU students along with other Afzal Guru sympathisers decided to take it a notch further and shout Anti-India and Pro-Pakistan slogans. THIS, chapatti mystery team, is beyond my sensitivity and sensibility. WE AND MY FELLOW INDIANS WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS. And most importantly Why did these guys resort to such extreme protest, I think we both know the agenda and the propaganda behind it. Don't we?<br />
If you have problem with the Government, delhi police, RSS or ABVP by all means you have the right to protest but DO NOT shout Anti-India slogans on my land. Anti-India slogans in any definition of patriotism will not make them a patriot in our eyes. Yes, we do have rights in our country and we also have set of duties towards our country and please don't forget that. And don't be afraid, the government and the agencies do not have the last word in this country. We have something called law and courts. If the crime of sedation has not been committed / proved then they will be released.  We don't hang, behead or even amputate people here just on the basis of some complaint or suspicion. : )<br />
P.S.: If you were protesting against capital punishment in the country, you could have used other examples instead of Afzal Guru. There were quite a few rapists who were given capital punishment for their heinous crimes.<br />
