<p>As you all must know by now (because I told you), Samip and Tina host the awesome podcast on all matters desi. <a href="http://www.radiostan.com/?p=31">Episode #4</a> is on Magic (white and black). An added bonus is that this episode also features me (!) delving a bit deeper into the whole <a href="/archives/homistan/oriental_magick.html">black magic ad</a> thing. A bit more. Literary agents are hereby notified that I can write you the next best-seller. </p>
<p>And let me also pimp the earlier 3 episodes of Radiostan, so far (on names (features C. M. Naim), Dreams and Brotherhood). It is a great little show, especially in the way they incorporate songs into the themes of the show. So, go listen and be entertained and educated. </p>
<p>(why do I have a fake pseudo-pakhtun accent during the phone call?)</p>
