<p>This is the most pathetic <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=426355">question</a> plus price.<br />
<img src="/images/question.jpg" align=center hspace=6 vspace=6><br />
And <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=423610">this</a>. And <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=412437">this</a> pissed me off (do read the NB at the end - god, I will have to teach such cretins for the rest of my life!). </p>
<p>Google Answers is the new google. Thank you Mark for providing a new source of entertainment!</p>
