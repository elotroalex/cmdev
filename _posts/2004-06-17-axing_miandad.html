  content: "dear readers\nit was an expected step by PCB, sacking yet another coach.
    but it should not be the criterion that team looses the match or series then you
    start blaming the coach or the captain.\nit is really ridiculous that PCB  is
    appointing yet another foreign coach, as for as i remember the team was really
    in good shape when they were playing under the supervision of mudassar nazar.but
    suddenly they hired a foriegn coach and we know what happened in worldcup 2003.\npakistan
    showed the worst performance in last worldcup under the supervision of a foreign
    coach.\nwhy PCB is spending lot of money for hiring a foreign coach.\ni can assure
    you that our cricket team is in the process rebuilding up. so let them rebuild.\nour
    team played really well against india keeping this fact in mind that they were
    inexperienced as compare to indian team.  \nmore then half our team can not understand
    english and PCB is hiring an english coach. also they need to hire an interpreter......"

<p><img src="/images/javed.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Pakistan <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/3812573.stm">sacked Javed Miandad</a> yesterday. I have to say that not only was this needed but way overdue. Miandad was a great cricketer but he sucked as a coach. Just in the last four years, the man has been fired, he resigned, he got left behind in New Zealand with the luggage.<br />
And of course, India whupping Pakistan's sagging behind did not help matters.<br />
If I was PCB, I would do a little bit more. Retire Rashid Latif, Shoaib Akhtar, Moin Khan. Make Yousaf Youhana captain. Put Imran Farhat and Taufeeq Umar as openers and get some new bowlers.<br />
And, please, HIRE A FITNESS COACH.<br />
PCB appointed <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/3815889.stm">Bob Woolmer</a> as the new coach. He might go the way of Richard Pybus. Or maybe, he can kick some ass. Lets hope so as Asia Cup is coming in July. Are the Bangladeshis still playing?</p>
