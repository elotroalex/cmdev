<p><img class="graphic" src="/images/blogday.gif">I honestly don't read many blogs - severe lack of time being the primary reason. Hence, my blogroll remains stagnant unless one of my gentle readers comments and leads me back to their house. So, for <a href="http://blogday.wikispaces.org/">Blog Day</a>, I decided to highlight some blogs that I only get to read now and then but which all of you should be reading every day. The first one is desi-driven but all the rest are Iranian bloggers writing in English.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.kitabkhana.blogspot.com/">KitabKhana</a>. A desi group blog that has all the book-smarts you can ever want.
<li><a href="http://www.broodingpersian.blogspot.com/">Brooding Persian</a>. Highly recommended.
<li><a href="http://www.iraniantruth.com/">Iranian Truth</a>. A group blog.
<li><a href="http://oxtay2.blogspot.com/">To Write or Not to Write</a>. In 3 Languages! Great read in any of them.
<li><a href="http://omidmemarian.blogspot.com/">Iranian Prospect</a>. A journalist.
</ul>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/BlogDay2005">Happy Blog Day to You</a>. Enjoy the Punch.</p>
