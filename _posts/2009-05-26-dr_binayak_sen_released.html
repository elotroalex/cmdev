<p>After two years, Dr. Sen was finally <a href="http://www.hindu.com/2009/05/26/stories/2009052657640100.htm">released on bail</a> by the Supreme Court. See <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/homistan/release_dr_binayak_sen.html">Free Dr. Binayak Sen</a> and, somewhat related, <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/homistan/new_prisons_for_old.html">New Prisons for Old</a>.</p>
