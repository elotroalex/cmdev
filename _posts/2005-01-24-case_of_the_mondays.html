  content: according to good morning america January 24 is rated the most depressing
    day of the year. Well I guess this year is a double dose with it being a monday
    as well.

    wow. You are correct, Azher.

  content: "Only reason I didn't like Monday 24 January is that it came following
    a long awaited long weekend (I got 3 days off in a row due to Baqr eid). So I
    greeted the day by sending a message (OSIM- Oh shit its Monday)on icq to one of
    my colleagues and then buried my head in the PC. \nMy dear Sepoy! I must tell
    you, despite all of the third world country crap, it ain't that bad here. Cheers!"

<p><img src="/img/hydrant.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Not a good week to come. There is an email burning holes in my inbox waiting to be answered. A lot of work is on the docket for the week and I am not feeling too peachy about any of it. </p>
<p>It snowed this weekend. Not a whole lot but more than the past few years. I think parts of the city got up to 15" of snow. In the HP, we barely topped 10", I suppose. I took some pictures of the campus this morning because Cheeni promised pics of Banglore palm trees in return and <i>those</i> sound a lot more fun.</p>
<p>Click <a href="/chisnow/index.html">here</a> to enjoy some snow fotos of the Uchicago campus.</p>
<p>Blogging will be of the slight variety this week. Unless I procrastinate.</p>
