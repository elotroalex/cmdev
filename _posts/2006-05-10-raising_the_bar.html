  content: I am reminded of a highlight from my first year at the Middle East Centre--in
    the midst of the interminable inaugural King Abdul Aziz ibn Saud lecture, delivered
    by some elderly German professor on the stimulating topic of "A Hundred Years
    of German-Saudi" relations or somesuch, the phone of one of the assorted Saudi
    digntaries in the front row of the lecture hall started ringing--with a tinny
    electronic version of the adhan.

  content: 'it may actually have been, though if so, no one else was observing it.  watching
    the various illustrious academics onstage struggle not to crack a smile was fun,
    though.  ah nostalgia: that was also the term thomas friedman came to speak, and
    ended up swearing at me.'
