<p>I am glad they got Zarqawi. Very glad. He was an evil terrorist who killed innocents in Iraq and Jordan. He was also a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/09/AR2006040900890_pf.html">deliberately constructed and hyped</a> one. </p>
<p>Mary Ann Weaver's <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/print/200607/zarqawi">The Short, Violent Life of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a> - soon to be the most linked article of the month - in <i>The Atlantic</i> spells it out: <i>He continued, &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&ordm;The Americans have been patently stupid in all of this. They&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;ve blown Zarqawi so out of proportion that, of course, his prestige has grown. And as a result, sleeper cells from all over Europe are coming to join him now.&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&sup1; He paused for a moment, then said, &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&ordm;Your government is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&sup1;</i></p>
