  content: wake up, sepoy -- the Supreme Court of Pakistan today July 31 2008 ruled
    that the Nov. 3 2007 PCO was unconstitutional, the Islamabad High Court is also
    out, and so are scores of PCO judges.  According to Ch Aitizaz Ahsan, Pervez Musharaff
    cannot find a lawyer to defend him at the Supreme Court (no one appeared in court).  NRO
    status still a bit cloudy.

  content: "DECISION IS BIGGEST FRAUD\r\n\r\n      The decision of Supreme Court dated
    31st of July 2009 as projected by media is the biggest Fraud in Judicial History
    of Pakistan when it says that PCO judges have been sent home. PCO Judges are still
    working and non PCO judges have been sacked, packed and sent home. The beneficiaries
    of the recent judgment are Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, Mr. Justice Javed
    Iqbal, Mr. Justice Sardar Muhammad Raza Khan, Mr. Justice Khalil-ur-Rehman Ramday
    Mr. Justice Mian Shakirullah Jan, Mr. Justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani etc. All
    these judges violated the constitutional oath and took fresh oath under the PCO
    of General Musharaf after Pakistan army ousted Nawaz Sharif in October of 1999.\r\n
    \     The other set of PCO judges are Justice Faqir Muhammad Khokhar and Justice
    Javed Buttar etc. including other judges in High Courts who took oath under the
    PCO on 3rd of November 1999. All of them are judges even today and are still continuing.\r\n
    \     Interestingly the judges who have been sent home had never taken oath under
    any PCO. Most of these Judges were not even appointed in General Musharaf&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    period. Infact they were appointed after the restoration of democracy in the country.
    The name of these judges who took oath under the constitution are as under:-\r\n
    \     1) Mr. Justice Pervez Ali Chawla\r\n      1) Mr. Justice Habib Ullah Shakir\r\n
    \     2) Mr. Justice Nazir Ahmed Ghazi\r\n      3) Mr. Justice Abdul Sattar Goraya\r\n
    \     4) Mr. Justice Syed Ihtasham Qadir Shah\r\n      5) Justice Ms. Jamila Jahanoor
    Aslam\r\n      6) Mr. Justice Mahmood Akhtar Khan\r\n      7) Mr. Justice Jamshed
    Rahmat Ullah\r\n      Mr. Justice Pervez Inayat Malik\r\n      9) Mr. Justice
    Arshad Mahmood\r\n      10) Mr. Justice Irfan Qadir\r\n      11) Mr. Justice Syed
    Zulfiqar Ali Bukhari\r\n      12) Mr. Justice Ch. Naeem Masood\r\n      13) Mr.
    Justice Anwar-ul-Haq Pannu\r\n      14) Mr. Justice Muhammad Shafqat Khan Abbasi\r\n
    \     15) Mr. Justice Imtiaz Rasheed Siddiqui\r\n      16) Mr. Justice Bin Yamin\r\n
    \     17) Mr. Justice Khalid Ali Z. Qazi\r\n      18) Mr. Justice Salman Ansari\r\n
    \     19) Mr. Justice Abdul Rehman Farooq Pirzada\r\n      20) Mr. Justice Abdul
    Rasheed Klwar\r\n      21) Mr. Justice Zafar Ahmed Khan Sherwani\r\n      22)
    Mr. Justice Syed Mehmood Alam Rizvi\r\n      23) Justice Ms. Soofia Latif\r\n
    \     24) Mr. Justice Maqbool Ahmed Awan\r\n      25) Mr. Justice Safdar Ahi Bhutto\r\n
    \     26) Mr. Justice Moharram G. Baloch\r\n      27) Mr. Justice Malik Muhammad
    Aqil\r\n      28) Mr. Justice Syed Shafaqat Ali Shah Masoomi\r\n      29) Mr.
    Justice Muhammad Iqbal Mahar\r\n      30) Mr. Justice Khadim Hussain M. Sheikh\r\n
    \     31) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ismail Bhutto\r\n      32) Mr. Justice Arshad Siraj
    Memon\r\n      33) Mr. Justice Aamir Raza Naqvi\r\n      34) Mr. Justice Muhammad
    Karim Khan Agha\r\n      35) Mr. Justice Salman Talibuddin\r\n      36) Mr. Justice
    Shaji Rehman Khan\r\n      37) Mr. Justice Ghulam Mohayuddin Malik\r\n      38)
    Mr. Justice Ziauddin Khattak\r\n      39) Mr. Justice Syed Mussaddiq Hussain Gilani\r\n
    \     40) Mr. Justice Syed Yahya Zahid Gilani\r\n      41) Mr. Justice Muhammad
    Alam Khan\r\n42) Justice Mazhar Hussain Minhas\r\n43) Justice Muhammad Ashraf
    Bhatti\r\n 44) Justice Rana Zahid Mehmood\r\n45) Justice Kazim Ali Malik\r\n46)
    Justice Hafiz Tariq Nasim\r\n47) Justice Khalil Ahmad\r\n48) Justice MA Zafar\r\n49)
    Justice Malik Saeed Ejaz\r\n 50) Justice Syed Shaheen Masud Rizvi\r\n51)  Justice
    Ali Akbar Qureshi \r\n 52) Justice Muhammad Ahsan Bhoon.\r\n\r\n      The aforesaid
    52 judges have never ever taken oath under the PCO. They have been ousted. The
    nation is celebrating and all the PCO judges are still continuing as judges. In
    short the fight between post November 3 PCO judges and post October 12 PCO judges
    has resulted in ouster of judges who took oath only under the Constitution of
    Pakistan and never ever under the PCO. The media, PML[N], the lawyers and other
    political forces are mixed up and are rejoicing the ouster of constitutionally
    appointed judges and PPP seems ignorant of this fact. Such things can only happen
    in Pakistan. After General Musharraf dislodged Nawaz&acirc;&euro;&trade;s government
    on 12th October 1999, Iftikhar Chaudhry in order to save his job took oath under
    the PCO. However when he lost his job on 3rd of November 2007 he condemned the
    PCO. Lets stop having double standards. All PCO judges should be removed regardless
    of the fact whether they took oath under the PCO before 2nd of November 2007 or
    thereafter. The irony is that PCO judges have removed those judges who took oath
    only under the constitution and never under any PCO."

    older posts which I find are much more readable and informative than some of the
    elusive recent posts and discussions.

<p>It is time for the annual CM slumber. I may poke my nose here if something compels but, really, I have a move to plan and execute. In the meantime, you can satiate yourself on my (in)frequent shoutouts on twitter.<br />
