<p>I know that Chapati Mystery has been archiving and publicizing such statements.  Please include the attached statement on your site if you are able.</p>
<p>Many thanks for all the good work you are doing to bring attention to the crisis at JNU.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br />

<p>University of Virginia&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Statement of Solidarity for JNU:</p>
<p>We, the undersigned students and faculty at the University of Virginia, stand in solidarity with the staff, students, and faculty at Jawarharlal University (JNU), New Delhi.  We share the outrage of citizens around the world who are aggrieved at the Modi government&acirc;&euro;&trade;s criminalization of student protest and dissent.  Further, we are extremely concerned by the government&acirc;&euro;&trade;s cavalier suppression of dissent as &acirc;&euro;&tilde;sedition&acirc;&euro;&trade; and &acirc;&euro;&tilde;anti-national&acirc;&euro;&trade;.  Freedom of speech and expression are cornerstones in any democracy.  Citizens&acirc;&euro;&trade; rights to express a plurality of beliefs and contrary opinions are essential to enabling a free, tolerant, and just society.  We thus condemn the arrest, detention, and prosecution of students, including Kanhaiya Kumar (President of JNU Students Union), who have exercised this fundamental right on the JNU campus. </p>
<p>We also condemn the state&acirc;&euro;&trade;s wanton use of police and legal powers to subdue the rights of students to gather peaceably and debate their political beliefs.  We are concerned that the persecution of students at JNU is galvanized by the state&acirc;&euro;&trade;s general repression of minorities, most notably evidenced in the tragic suicide of the Dalit student Rohith Vemula at the University of Hyderabad and the controversial execution of Afzal Guru.  We value the resilience of the members of the JNU community who are now in the midst of the struggle.  We also recognize the ties between the crackdown at JNU and other similar virulent state actions against some of India&acirc;&euro;&trade;s most excellent institutions of higher education: Jadavpur University, Kolkata; the University of Hyderabad; Film and Television Institute of India; and others.  JNU&acirc;&euro;&trade;s preeminent reputation in India as an institution that fosters path-breaking scholarship, social activism, and critical thought is truly global.  It is our hope that this statement of solidarity, by reaching across boundaries, affirms the exalted regard with which JNU is held in the international community of scholars.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that JNU can carry on with its educational mission, we urge the Government of India to remedy the situation immediately.  To this end, we ask that the students arrested under false charges of &acirc;&euro;&tilde;sedition&acirc;&euro;&trade; be released immediately, that all charges against them be dropped, and that police incursions into campus activities cease.  We call on the Vice Chancellor of JNU to uphold the university&acirc;&euro;&trade;s global reputation for safeguarding free and independent thought by protecting its most vulnerable members and students. </p>
<p>Founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, the University of Virginia aspires to extend universally the rights of equality, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness imagined by its founder.  Even so, UVA continues to face its own struggles against discrimination based on race, class, religion, gender, and sex.  It is in the name of these struggles on our own historic Grounds that members of this university find it urgent to speak out in solidarity with JNU and against the suppression of minority voices in India.</p>
