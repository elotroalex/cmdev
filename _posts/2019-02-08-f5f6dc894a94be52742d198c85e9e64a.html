<p>Hi there, my name is Chris Moffat and I'm currently a Postdoc in the School of History at Queen Mary University of London. </p>
<p>I've recently published my first book, 'India's Revolutionary Inheritance: Politics and the Promise of Bhagat Singh', with Cambridge University Press: http://bit.ly/2RkawC5. I wanted to get in touch (especially following the open call posted on the website last summer) about the possibility of doing an XQ feature on the book, or perhaps even a roundtable if you think worthwhile! As a long-time reader and admirer of Chapati Mystery, it would truly be an honour. Please let me know what you think: I can arrange with CUP for one or multiple review copies to be sent, as required. Hope the book - which looks at the afterlives of anticolonial violence and the disruptive potential of the dead in postcolonial politics - will be of interest to your readers. Very much appreciate your time. </p>
<p>Best,<br />
Chris<br />
