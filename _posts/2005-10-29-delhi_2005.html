    Fingers point to Lashkar-e-Toiba...

    The Na Pak Fauj created a monster a few years back, and we'll pay the price for it...

    Horrific tragedy.

    Beautiful poem.

    This year has been too full of sorrow.

    Peace,

<p>The parade of cities on the war-path of terrorists continues. I mourn for the victims. People who were shopping for happiness. Diwali. Eid. Children. Innocents all. </p>
<p>No hell is enough for these terrorists. No outrage sufficient. </p>
<p>A snapshot of Delhi from Agha Shahid Ali:</p>
<p><center><b>Chandni Chowk, Delhi</b></p>
<p>
Swallow this summer street,<br />
then wait for the monsoon.<br />
Needles of rain<br />
melt on the tongue. "Will you go<br />
farther? A memory of drought<br />
holds you: you remember<br />
the taste of hungry words<br />
and you chew syllables of salt.<br />
Can you rinse away this city that lasts<br />
like blood on the bitten tongue?<br /></center></p>
