<p>I do love the brits. From today's reading of the <i>Times</i> online:</p>
<p><b>Article One:</b><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1808666,00.html"> Freedom to interfere? No minister, it's too sensitive</a>. The article is brilliant for these reasons:</p>
<p>1. It references <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/y/yesminister_7777145.shtml">Yes, Minister</a> - a great tv show that I worshipped.<br />
2. It says " a mandarin wrote" - a "mandarin" being an obstructionist bureaucrat in Brit-speak.<br />
3. There is a Histories, Openness and Records Unit of the Cabinet Office.<br />
4. The bureaucracy: "The 33 caseworkers handling appeals against refusals to disclose documents face a backlog of more than 1,200 cases &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&dagger; which at the current workrate may take eight years to clear."</p>
<p><b>Article Two</b>: <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1808966,00.html">Bells, bagpipes and a bit of a do . . . Ukrainian style</a>. An equally brilliant read:</p>
<p>1. The snark is off the hook: "Tattooed Yorkshiremen mingled with the 100 well-wishers who chanted &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&circ;&laquo;Happiness! Happiness!&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Iuml;&euro; as the couple briefly posed for photographs and sipped champagne. Mr Carr smashed his glass on the pavement. This would probably have got him an ASBO back in Leeds, but here it was received with rapturous applause from Yuliya Tymoshenko, his new mother-in-law, who made an estimated $6 billion in the energy business in the 1990s and then co-led the Orange Revolution last year."<br />
2. It gave me a chance, once more, to GIS <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=Yuliya+Tymoshenko&hl=en&btnG=Search+Images">Yuliya Tymoshenko</a>. And, we get Harriet Miers.<br />
3. The bio-sketches of the couple at the end which include this detail: "His tattoos include a large alien emerging from his stomach".</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
