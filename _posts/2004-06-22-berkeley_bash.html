    True Story: the monkeys in Benares once grabbed a packet of Parle G biscuits right out of my hand and made off with it. They dont NEED to be fed!

<p>I am in Berkeley CA for two days giving a talk on something or the other. Not quite sure but it is tomorrow morning at 9:45.<br />
There is shopping planned.<br />
Pub crawl.<br />
And maybe a movie as well.<br />
I love San Francisco.<br />
<b>update</b>: No, <i>sven</i>, I have just been informed that my talk is entitled <i>History of Islam in India</i>. I have 40 minutes. I think that will be just about enough time to set up the slide projector, no?<br />
I am a bit miffed as I was hoping to give the talk entitled <i>Don't Feed The Monkeys in Benares</i>. Ed got that one. Lucky bastard.</p>
