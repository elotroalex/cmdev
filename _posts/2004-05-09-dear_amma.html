<p>Happy Mother's Day to my dearest Amma who waited and waited, at the doorstep, for me to come home every evening from college.<br />
<!--more--><br />
And also, forbade me from learning to swim in case I drowned. And furthermore, made me drink karayla ka juice until my innards turned green. You are the coolest Amma and I am a terrible son but I love you more than anything else.<br />
