<p>Gentle Readers,</p>
<p>My <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/20/opinion/half-a-cheer-for-democracy-in-pakistan.html">op-ed</a> in NYT on the recent FATA/administrative developments that connects the history of spatial politics and territorial otherness.</p>
<blockquote><p> The nearly 40-year war in Afghanistan has produced its own idea of the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;tribal&acirc;&euro; in Pakistan&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Tribal Areas &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; one that took the British colonial emphasis on &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Pashtun&acirc;&euro; militancy and layered on top the American enemy, the Afghan Taliban. The Tribal Areas went from being a base for Pakistan and American military operations against Soviet troops to a platform for Taliban militancy against the United States and Pakistan. Deemed a geography outside the laws of the nation, the Tribal Areas were found by both the militant and the anti-militant forces a region where violence could be meted out with little regard to its inhabitants.</p>
<p>Pakistan has kept the frontiers in place, legally and spatially. Continuing the colonial practices, the president of Pakistan appoints a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;political agent&acirc;&euro; in the Tribal Areas to keep power centralized. The political agent is the sole arbiter of law and order and one without any responsibility toward the people. The ethnic stereotyping and animosity has deliberately deprived the Tribal Areas of schools and hospitals. The war on terrorism has instead turned it into a landscape covered in police and surveillance stations.</p>
