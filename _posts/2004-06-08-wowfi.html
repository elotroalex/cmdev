<p><img src="/images/airtunes.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>I am stuck today in database training hell. I always wonder about the differences between humanities teaching, sciences teaching and then application/technical teaching. The goals are so very different. The instructor has to simply walk through a manual while anticipating dumb question. A CDROM should be able to do this. Our instructor is nice enough, but how can she remain sane doing the same 200 page manual every day of her life? And <a href="http://www.iseemonsters.com">sven</a> asking questions all the time? I don't know what I am doing here.<br />
Anyways, behold the object of my new lust: <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/">AirPort Express</a>.<br />
I have at home an Airport Extreme set up but the signal is kinda weak in the living room [probably, 'cause of my 2.4Ghz phone] and I also have a iPod that I cannot enjoy on my surround-sound. Well, from my mouth to Jobs' ears - he done gone made the sexiest thing - a device that will act as both a bridge for my Airport <i>and</i> stream my iPod to my iStereo for my iHome to be iPerfect. iSigh.</p>
