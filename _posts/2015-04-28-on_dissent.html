<p>Over at <em>The Hindu</em>, a slightly longer version of my thoughts on the assassination of Sabeen  Mahmud.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/sabeen-mahmud-assassination-crushing-voices-of-dissent/article7147452.ece">Crushing voices of dissent</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The crime of the intellectual is to create the scene of the crime. The scene of the crime is a space &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; whether concrete or metaphoric &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; in which dialogue can exist. Their crime is in expressing or harbouring dissent. And the punishment is always death.</p></blockquote>
