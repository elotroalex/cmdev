  content: When I found out that she was in Islamabad, I actually booked a flight
    up there, because despite the whole gay thing, I LOVE her.  LOVE.  And then I
    found out that half my Isloo friends have had dinner with her, and most certainly
    aren't shy about flaunting that.

    Sin: What'd your friends say about her? And more importantly, did she have anything to say? How's her Urdu lately?

    Personally I think the salwar kameez looks fantastic, and am glad she's setting a good example for other western women who visit.

    judging from her movies she has as much understanding of the afghan refugees' plight as
    of the monkey-godlike figures she fights on the screen .the firanghi step over  the subcontinent's 'dukhti rugs'every chance they get and all the natives do is admire their rags.

<p><img class="graphic" src="/images/jolie.jpg">Back in the days, the Afghan refugee camps were a <a href="http://www.ratherbiased.com/video_gunga.htm">must-visit</a> for NY, DC and LA celebs [see <i>Charlie Wilson's War</i>]. Such hasn't been the case in a while. Angelina Jolie, who spreads Goodwill as a UN Ambassador, is currently <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-05-04-jolie-pakistan_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA">visiting</a> the camps outside Peshawar. She has been there before in August 2001 and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743470230/qid=1115406210/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-5305859-7265767?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">published</a> her journals as well. In late September 2001, she <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/28/rec.jolie.donation/">donated</a> $1 Million to the relief fund for Afghani refugees. Remarkably good of her.</p>
<p>Let me get the shallow bit out by pointing out that she looks damn <a href="http://editorial.gettyimages.com/source/search/details_pop.aspx?iid=52760949&cdi=0">fine</a> in the shalwar kameez. On a more serious note, I have been to the refugee camps and I applaud Ms. Jolie and her work on behalf of the refugees of the world. CM editorial board endorses your purchase of any Jolie-associated products. Ah. I just cannot get serious this friday. </p>
<p>Have a good weekend, gentle readers.</p>
