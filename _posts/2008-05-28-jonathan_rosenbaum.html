<p>I have long admired Rosenbaum as one of the two premier critics in Chicago (the other one should be an obvious guess). He has now retired from the erstwhile Chicago Reader and all his <a href="http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.com/">reviews</a> are now online. Including one of my <a href="http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.com/?p=6542">favorite one</a> - on Joe Dante's <i>Small Soldiers</i> and Steven Spielberg's <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>.</p>
