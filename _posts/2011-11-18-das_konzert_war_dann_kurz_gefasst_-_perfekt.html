<p><em>Taste the war paint on my tongue/as it's dripping with my sweat/place my gaze in the futures path/seeing things that ain't come yet</em></p>
<p>Many years ago, a different me was in a car driving down a highway I had travelled many hundreds of time to a destination I was intimate with, and from a base which was called home. I guess it was 2001-2? I was thinking, listening to My Morning Jacket (review of <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15471-circuital/">Circuital</a>), on the car's cd player that I must talk to farangi about this band. Must. This was the best of jam-band and this guy had a voice that I couldn't quite believe. Plus, they were from Kentucky - a place that is well, legend to me.</p>
<p><em>watchin' a stretch of road, miles of light explode/driftin' off a thing i'd never done before</em></p>
<p>Plus, they seemed not only to be amazing musicians but also had a deft way with lyrics. I liked them. </p>
<p>Every one else in the car hated them.</p>
<p>Years passed and they released more records, which I purchased. Listened to them. They toured within reach of me. But I never saw them. Once, I remember trying to make a plan with farangi to watch them, but who knows. We didn't.</p>
<p>A few nights ago, I <a href="http://www.taz.de/1/berlin/tazplan-kultur/artikel/?dig=2011%2F11%2F18%2Fa0159&cHash=49c52a9863">saw them in Berlin</a>. In a very intimate little venue in Kreuzberg. I saw Jim James channel his inner qawwal and dance as if the haal was on him. When they started "Outta my system" I was bouncing from the ceiling. Standing within arm's reach of the band, the sheer weight of polished rocking inexorably lifted all weights on me. </p>
<p>Have you ever lost yourself at a rock concert? </p>
<p>But, here is the well thing. At one point Jim James puts a towel over his head and sings through "Gideon" and "Mahgeetah" and I am transposed immediately to the haal-singers in sufi circles in Lahore, where the act of veiling is precisely to note that the voice coming out is supernatural. James' voice is supernatural. </p>
<p>Thanks, Berlin. </p>
<p>Oh, and after, the roadie tossed me the set-list. Guess a salt-and-peppered-bearded-brown guy bouncing all night elicits sympathies. </p>
