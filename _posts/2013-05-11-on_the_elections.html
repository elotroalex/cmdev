<p>I have an op-ed in NYT on the subject of elections and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/opinion/pakistans-tyrannical-majority.html">minority rights</a> in Pakistan:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Saturday, Pakistanis will head to the polls to choose a new government; for the first time in 66 years, a democratically elected administration has completed its term. Given Pakistan&acirc;&euro;&trade;s tumultuous past, this is an impressive achievement, but it should not prevent citizens from asking the candidates vying for their votes: what kind of Pakistan have you made?</p></blockquote>
<p>Do read & c;</p>
