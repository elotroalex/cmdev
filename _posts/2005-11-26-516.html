  content: I don't use a Mac, so do not know about keyboard layouts there, but it
    seems the layout you are using (and Khawar too) have the "heh" character mapped
    wrong. It should be &#x06C1; but instead it is &#x06D5;.

    i can read your urdu post in opera but not in ie!

    just an idea: we can increase urdu usage in blogging by introducing something like an on-screen urdu keyboard, successfully being used at urduseek.com.
