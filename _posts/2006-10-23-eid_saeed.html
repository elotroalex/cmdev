    Crap... I need to keep track of this stuff. Well, that means I CAN eat in public now (but I will miss the excuse for acting sullen and irritable).



    In any case, Eid Mubarak from me too!

    "It will be the best day, ever."



    Awww, exactly. That's exactly what Eid is, every year, every Eid.



    A belated Eid Mubarak to you and yours too.

<p><img src="/images/eidhug.jpg"/>Today, I will not go to work. I will stay at home and finish up decorating. We will all wear our new clothes and hug our parents and grandparents. Friends will stop by all day - dressed fresh and clean. We will exchange those three-pump hugs that I can never get right - left shoulder, right shoulder, left shoulder? - and drink <a href="http://hm.hamdard.com:5050/rooh_afza/rooh_afza.htm">Rooh Afza</a> and eat Saywiyyan with almonds. The kids will run around, shiny and jingly. They will climb on everyone and stand before us - hands extended for their eidi. .</p>
<p>Dinner will get served at 2. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihari">Nihari</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biryani">Biryani</a>. Cars will leave, packed to the hilt with relatives, to houses far and near. At every stop, a new embrace. A new smile. We will, maybe fight about the movie to watch. Or maybe some cricket match will be on the t.v. Our pockets will be heavy with the cash-gifts. We will remember that we haven't seen someone all day and everyone will rush to call and be the first to wish Eid. </p>
<p>It will be the best day, ever.</p>
<p>Eid Mubarak and, as someone else put it, a late Diwali Mubarak to all my gentle readers. May you and yours always remain together. </p>
