<p>About the departing Derbyshire batsman Hassan Adnan: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/counties/derbyshire/7018811.stm">"It's never nice informing players they have to go, especially when it is such a loyal servant and great team man," Derbyshire chief John Morris said.</a></p>
<p>'A loyal Servant' musta have different connotation in the UK sports arena ... but I was kinda jarred on my first read.</p>
