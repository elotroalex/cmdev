<p>In my last post, I mentioned the fall of Baghdad at the hands of Hulegu in 1258 as being a pivotal event [apologies to readers unable to read squiggles]. I thought it would be interesting to give some examples from poetry and prose depicting the Fall. </p>
<p>But, I found this <a href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/634/bo2.htm">article</a> by Amina Elbendary that hits most of my points AND has the qasida that I wanted to post here today. So, go read it there. I will just note that the <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9062108">qasida</a> at the end of the article is in the  <i>marsiya</i> genre - a lament for the dead - in this case, the city itself. </p>
<p>In more general news, I bemoan my lack of initiative in dredging up the minutiae of history for you. But, this time of the year is so un-suited for blogging, really. Hiatus, unless something catches my eye. Which is really status quo, no?</p>
