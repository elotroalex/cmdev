<p>In your 8/25 column,<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/25/opinion/25brooks.html"> Divided They Stand</a>, you conclude:</p>
<div id="blockquoted">But when you get Galbraith and Gerecht in the same mood, you know something important has happened. The U.S. has orchestrated a document that is organically Iraqi.</p>
<p>It's their country, after all.</p></div>
<p>However in your entire piece there is not a single quote from any actual Iraqi who may or may not have any opinion on the constitution. As I see it, you have demonstrated the myopia of the American enterprise in Iraq perfectly - American analysts talking about perceptions in the American media as counter spin in an American op-ed for American audience.</p>
<p>Since you couldn't find any "IRAQI" to tell you anything about what that constitution means to them, I really fail to see your conclusion. I take your words of esteem for "Peter W. Galbraith, a former United States ambassador to Croatia, and smart Iraq analyst, Reuel Marc Gerecht, formerly of the C.I.A. and now at the American Enterprise Institute" but I doubt that they call Iraq their country.</p>
<p>If you would like to get the Baghdad street view of the Constitution, perhaps you can call someone who is 1. An Iraqi 2. In Baghdad 3. Involved in the Constitution making process. THEN, you can conclude whether the Iraqi constitution is organic or not.</p>
<p>cheers,<br />
