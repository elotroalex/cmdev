<p><strong>Tentative title:<br />
The sentimental and the melodramatic: exploring Partition aesthetics</strong></p>
<p>We seek essays for a volume (Routledge) looking at the sentimental and melodramatic aesthetics<br />
of images, art, gossip, and writings that remind us of the unspeakable acts of 1947 and their<br />
political and cultural aftershocks in Punjab and Bengal. Critics<br />
who have variously written about the scale of sexual violence and disruption of everyday life, the<br />
many kinds of injustices meted out to the homeless refugees, economic meltdowns, and many<br />
other social and political issues, have somehow found it vexing that the stories of the displaced<br />
are inchoate and unrelentingly sentimental, often bordering on fantasy. Instead of exploring these<br />
sentimental kaleidoscopes, they dismiss them as sounds of silence, amnesia, cultural aphasia,<br />
life in a social vacuum, and so on. The present volume breaks new ground by emphasizing the<br />
sentimental and the melodramatic as a tremendous place to think about affects, subjectivities,<br />
ethics, and recognition of life during and after the notorious event.</p>
<p>We welcome close readings of stories, memoirs and other texts, and ethnographies of any kind,<br />
particularly those that explore biases, affects, desires, and subjectivities.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, we welcome essays that share the photographic memories of peoples, places,<br />
and events not merely to represent the graphic nature of pathological violence, displacement and<br />
so on, but to look closely at frozen moments and gestures that seem to have produced defining<br />
features of our mental worlds as critics and interlocutors.</p>
<p>We particularly welcome essays emphasizing the inventions of popular and art house cinematic<br />
genres and mythologies from the 1940s to the present in which memories of underdevelopment,<br />
critiques of communist and post-nationalist dystopias, and a profound sense of the ennui of<br />
political processes are evident.</p>
<p>We welcome essays on narratives written partially or entirely in dialects in cosmopolitan and<br />
semi-urban places in the subcontinent as well as the diaspora.</p>
<p>We are excited to learn about the transit routes that made possible complex decisions such as<br />
moving one&acirc;&euro;&trade;s home in 1948 as well as during the Bangladesh War of 1971.</p>
<p>We welcome essays on any other ideas not covered by these outlines as long as they theoretically<br />
engage culture as an inclusive category and are focused on the geocultural politics of the Partition.</p>
<p>Affective readings will not be turned away and non-traditional approaches to essay writing are particularly encouraged.</p>
<p>Please send 500 word paper abstracts to the editors: <a href="mailto:lapatastic@gmail.com">Daisy Rockwell</a> and<br />
<a href="mailto:abhijeet@berkeley.edu">Abhijeet Paul</a> by March 1, 2013. Final papers are due in October 2013<br />
when the proposal is formally accepted by Routledge. Essays should not be more than 8000-<br />
10,000 words (20-25 pages including footnotes). If your essay is more than the desired length,<br />
please send us an email first. Essays should be original and not previously published.</p>
