<p>One of my year-end pleasures is reading <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2132498/entry/2133364/nav/tap2/">Slate's Annual Movie Club</a> w/ a rotating roster of movie critics. This year, we get one of my fav. film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum of <i>The Reader</i> back! Just read that first letter.</p>
