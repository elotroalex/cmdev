<p>I had no idea that Pakistan was important BEFORE Sep 11, 2001. Listen to Rice's testimony: "America's Al Qaida policy wasn't working because our Afghanistan policy wasn't working, and our Afghanistan policy wasn't working because our Pakistan policy wasn't working." In fact Pakistan was mentioned 27 times by Rice, while Iraq only got 26 shout-outs. so there.<br />
In fact, the WTC in '93, the embassy bombings in Kenya, the Cole attack in the Persian Gulf, the Khartoum fiasco, it all did NOT result in a comprehensive Al Qaida strategy because America had shoved Pakistan under the rug since 1989.</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>I am becoming a big fan of the various domino scenarios the administration brings out. Pakistan / Afghanistan / Taliban or Iraq / Syria / Iran / restofthemiddleeast.<br />
States capitulate and change course because the comprehensive game plan of the administration leaves them no recourse. When is Iraq inviting Syria and Iran for democracy sleep-overs?</p>
<p>more later.<br />
