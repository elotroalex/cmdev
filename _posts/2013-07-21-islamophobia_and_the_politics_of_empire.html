<p>I reviewed a couple of new(ish) books. Following are snippets from the two reviews.</p>
<p><a href="http://x.dawn.com/2013/04/14/review-terrifying-muslims-race-and-labor-in-the-south-asian-diaspora/">Junaid Rana,&Acirc;&nbsp;<em>Terrifying Muslims: Race and Labor in the South Asian Diaspora</em></a></p>
<blockquote><p><img class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://dawncompk.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/terrifying.jpg?w=198&amp;h=300" width="119" height="179" />A few days after 9/11, Mark Stroman walked into a Dallas petrol pump and shot the attendant, Rais Bhuyian, in the face. Before pulling the trigger, he asked the Bangladeshi immigrant where he was from. His answer did not matter. Bhuyian survived, but not Waqar Hasan, a Pakistani immigrant whom Stroman had shot a few days earlier. A few days later, he would kill again. This time it was an Indian immigrant, Vasudev Patel. All three of his victims worked at convenience stores. All three were South Asian immigrants. After his arrest, Stroman boasted of being the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Arab Slayer&acirc;&euro; avenging 9/11.</p>

<p><a href="http://beta.dawn.com/news/1024393/cover-story-review-of-deepa-kumars-islamophobia-and-the-politics-of-empire?view=print">Deepa Kumar,&Acirc;&nbsp;<em>Islamophobia and the Politics of Empire</em>.</a></p>
<blockquote><p><img class="alignright" alt="" src="https://sites.google.com/site/profdeepakumar/_/rsrc/1344622959597/latest-1/Islamophobia_Cover_small.jpg" width="140" height="220" />The racism at the heart of modern imperial violence operates on indifference as much as on explicit hatred. The indifference to the many that die &acirc;&euro;&oelig;over there&acirc;&euro; in the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;badlands,&acirc;&euro; that such brutal military assaults can only be launched at will on a non-Western population, that the blatant state surveillance of entire neighbourhoods inside the US based on ethnicity and religion can only happen to the &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Little Pakistans&acirc;&euro;&trade; &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; all of this requires rendering certain people as justified &acirc;&euro;&tilde;collateral damage&acirc;&euro;&trade; to the civilising imperial mission.&Acirc;&nbsp;It is this imperial racism and the dehumanising Islamophobic rhetoric of the so-called &acirc;&euro;&tilde;war on terror&acirc;&euro;&trade; that Kumar brings into focus in this most valuable primer. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Drawing on my academic training as a cultural theorist,&acirc;&euro; Kumar writes, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;I situate the rhetoric of Islamophobia within the broader political, historical, legal, and social context from which it emerges to show that anti-Muslim racism has been primarily a tool of the elite in various societies.&acirc;&euro;</p></blockquote>
