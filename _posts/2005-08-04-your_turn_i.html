  content: Frankly, your article was a complete load of crap. I'm glad somebody had
    the sense to dish right back at you.

    done THE WEENIEST THING EVER.

<p><img class="graphic" src="/images/soapbox.jpg"><i>My bilious nature has interrupted my "hiatus" [maintaining radio silence is more often than not a supreme skill taught only to those inducted into the daiymo Bloguwa]. But while contemplating my silence, I had decided to do what everyone who really knows me says I do best: Delegate. I emailed some of my readers and asked them to contribute a word or two to CM. At first the plan was to do a whole guest week but, I don't know if enough of my initial invitees will have time to respond. So, I have decided to tweak it a bit. As a recurring feature, I will post thoughts of the CM crowd for my substantial DHS and DOJ audience. First up is <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sumanah/ces.shtml">Sumana</a>. She has been with CM since the beginning and I had the pleasure of meeting her while in San Francisco. My first blog connection, it was. Below is what she had to say.</i></p>
<div id="blockquoted">Since sepoy is oh so occupied, I will provide some amusing baubles in his stead.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sumanah/cgi-bin/nb/nb.cgi/portal/spam">The least Indian of my endeavors</a> is the group blog Spam As Folk Art where we turn straw into comedy gold.</p>
<p>Slightly more Indian: <a href="http://www.insidebayarea.com/bayarealiving/mcmasala">MC Masala</a>, where I spew self-indulgent columny [sic] over the Bay east and south of San Francisco.  Rejected titles for my column included "Brown Peril" and "I Took Your Job," although "Idli Hands" was most groanworthy.  I wonder how many people would have believed "Gandhi Built The Taj."</p>
<p>Most Indian: <a href="http://mysticindica.blogspot.com/2005/03/i-am-indian.html">an Indian woman living in the US completely misunderstands</a> the last third of a <a href="http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2004/03/10/call_center/">Salon article I wrote</a> about the mirror-mirror experience of visiting a Bangalore call center.  I was asking a lot of rhetorical questions that she took as declarative sentences, and I wince when I see her (and possibly other readers) reading a meditation on circumstance as a screed against my own family.</p>
<p>I will take a lump on "For me it is a job, and for them it is liberation." Wagewise and skillwise, their job is more liberating to them than mine is to me, but it's still a figurative overstatement.</p>
<p>She thought I was being condescending, sneering at my Indian peers, even though the whole point of the article was that I see them and me as two sides of the same coin.  Maybe it's the fact that I considered the parallels at all that bothered her - American-born Indians aren't to talk about the home country in public except in glowing praise for its infinite authenticity.</p>
<p>I've read her blog so I know she's thoughtful and that I disagree with her on some things (like Hindutva).  I think she seized on something that wasn't really there.  She commented on my article a year after I wrote it, so maybe she was missing the context of contemporaneous Salon articles. I'd seen story after story about globalization, offshoring, and outsourcing.  Mine was a personal, pro-India perspective among them.</p>
<p>I can ramble as much as I like, but it's just that it feels bad being misunderstood.  I can cheer myself up with a typo I spotted in a recent book: "I was faced with a Hobbesian choice."  Would you like that solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, or short?</p>
