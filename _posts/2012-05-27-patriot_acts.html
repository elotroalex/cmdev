<p>I reviewed Alia Malek's&Acirc;&nbsp;<em><strong><a href="http://www.voiceofwitness.com/after-911">Patriot Acts: Narratives of Post-9/11 Injustice</a>&Acirc;&nbsp;</strong></em>for Dawn. You can read the full review <a href="http://dawn.com/2012/05/27/cover-story-archipelago-of-injustices/">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.voiceofwitness.com/after-911"><img class="alignright" src="http://voiceofwitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/PatriotActs_flat2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>On March 21, 2012, Shaima Alawadi, a 32-year-old Iraqi woman, was fatally beaten with a tire iron in Southern California. A note found near her said, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;This is my country.&Acirc;&nbsp;Go back to yours, terrorist.&acirc;&euro; The investigators asserted that it was an isolated incident and that other Iraqis need not worry. Lumping disparate peoples into threats and describing violence against them as &acirc;&euro;&oelig;isolated incidents&acirc;&euro; works in tandem. The former justifies sustained violence and the latter diverts our attention from the systemic nature of this violence. What we see instead are exceptional events &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; &acirc;&euro;&oelig;isolated incidents&acirc;&euro; of violence suspended outside the broader societal context and exigencies of the national security state. We don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t see them as the latest in a long chain of violence on a particular group of people or an episode in the nation&acirc;&euro;&trade;s deep history of violence and dispossession.</p>
<p>Alia Malek&acirc;&euro;&trade;s work of oral history, Patriot Acts: Narratives of Post-9/11 Injustice, gives the lie to the frame &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; isolated incident &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; that holds within it the image of the idyllic American society as it effaces its systematic injustices.&Acirc;&nbsp;By including the violated as victims of isolated crimes, this frame excludes the chorus of their voices. It shuts out the stories of unrelenting violence: of racial terrors such as beatings and violent deaths; of legal terrors such as incarcerations, detentions, and deportations; of routine, everyday violence such as bullying at school, employment discrimination, travelling made arduous, racist jibes and sneers. In Malek&acirc;&euro;&trade;s words, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;the personal stories and lived experiences of these realities remain excluded from the general understanding of the American experience, as well as the mainstream narrative about 9/11 and the War on Terror.&acirc;&euro; In Patriot Acts that chorus pushes at the constricting margins of the frame and enables us to see the lives damaged and the families shattered by America&acirc;&euro;&trade;s domestic war on terror.&Acirc;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/2591/listen"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.jadaliyya.com/content_images/fck_images/timthumb.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></a></p></blockquote>
