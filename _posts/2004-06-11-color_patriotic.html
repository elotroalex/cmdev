<p><img src="/images/duck.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Disney released its wartime propoganda films on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000BWVAH/104-5461921-5830331?v=glance">DVD</a>. Like all other industries, during the Great War, the Movie Studios turned themselves over to the Pentagon for the war efforts (hey, we got a Great Communicator out of it). Disney was perhaps the most effective of all wartime propoganda machines. These shorts have not been released since the end of the war, and I don't know why Eisner is releasing them now. They are patriotic, duh, and also figure gross carcicatures of the enemy, both Jap and Nazi. Disney's talents were considered <a href="http://www.ocweekly.com/ink/04/40/film-arellano.php">essential</a> in the war effort as was their talent in making evil, evil:</p>
<div class=quote><img src="/images/startquote.gif">None do so more viciously than the aforementioned Der Fuehrer&Atilde;&rdquo;&Atilde;&cedil;&Icirc;&copy;s Face (which imagines Donald Duck as a swastika-bedecked Nazi manufacturing munitions while heiling Hitler about every other second) and the somber Education for Death (the biography of a blond German boy who devolves from wide-eyed innocent to Hitler Youth to a graveyard). In both films, Japanese are portrayed as green-skinned fops and Germans function as little better than human bulldogs. <img src="/images/endquote.gif"></div>
<p>While, this war is getting bogged down in pesky "torture" issues. It's good to buy for your children stories of a war where evil was truly evil and good, well, cartoonishly good.</p>
<p><b>September, 2005 Update</b>: Jeremy Boggs has a <a href="http://www.clioweb.org/openseason/">great site</a> of wartime japanese propoganda.</p>
