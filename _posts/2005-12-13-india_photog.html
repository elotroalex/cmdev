    I have enjoyed reading CM for some time, and thanks for noticing my musings.



    "Where are the people?" you ask.  Some are there: tourguides, tourists, wedding-goers (in a different photo gallery http://www.jeffmatherphotography.com/galleries/India_wedding.php).  Most everybody else had the good sense to be inside when it was 40+ degrees outside in June.  And to be honest, it's really hard for a couple of white folks to walk around Delhi by themselves, blend in, and be unhassled enough to photograph at will.  So there are a lot of images of touristy places.



    There were other folks, of course -- workers, travelers, people hanging out, children, beggars -- just like everywhere else.  Here in the States, I'm getting more confident at appropriating peoples' likenesses; but I balked at photographing many of the things that would have shown more of the "Indian experience" we were having.  Sometimes I wasn't sure of the propriety, and other times I realized the photos would have said more about me than the people I met.



    Next time, when I go back with some NRI friends, I'll get you a tenement tenant or two...
