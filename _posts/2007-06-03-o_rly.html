<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6714545.stm">According to the Daily Mail, police in Kingston now believe Mr Woolmer died of natural causes, brought on by chronic ill-health and possibly diabetes.</a></p>
<p>I like <a href="http://content-www.cricinfo.com/woolmer/content/current/story/291969.html">the snake venom</a> theory better.</p>
