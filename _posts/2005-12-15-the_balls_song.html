<p><a href="http://sport.guardian.co.uk/englandinpakistan/story/0,16791,1668156,00.html">"There is an old Pakistani drinking song that roughly translated is called 'We have hold of your balls and we are squeezing',</a>" claims <a href="http://sport.guardian.co.uk/englandinpakistan/story/0,16791,1667712,00.html">Kurt Stengel</a>. "I would like to suggest that this is THE song of the tour. End of argument."</p>
