<p><img src="/images/hoax.jpg" hspace=6 align=left>The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1218532,00.html"> assassination</a> of CPA President, Sy Hersh's latest article detailing <a href="http://newyorker.com/fact/content/?040524fa_fact">Operation Copper Green</a>, Newsweek's piece on <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4989422/">torture</a> rules initiated by the Pentagon.<br />
Lots of bad news to digest, to think about, to mull. And what do I get in my inbox from 2 separate sources this morning? THE ANCIENT RACE OF AAD FOUND IN SAUDI ARABIA. QURANIC HISTORY IS TRUE!!! This contribution to the world investigative pool is made by Bangladesh's Independent News Source: <a href="http://nation.ittefaq.com/artman/publish/article_8519.shtml">The New Nation</a>.<br />
