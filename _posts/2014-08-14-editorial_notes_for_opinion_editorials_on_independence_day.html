<p>Open with Nehru's "Tryst with Destiny" if you are a male* Indian/Gora author.<br />
Open with Jinnah's "You are Free to Go" if you are a male Pakistani author.<br />
No one will ask you to write anything if you belong to current state of Bangladesh, so do not worry (one imagines you may have something to say about 1947). </p>
<p>Connect Nehru to Development; development to Congress; Congress to Decline; And turn to Modi, and open Markets. This should take one paragraph.<br />
Connect Jinnah to secularism; secularism to Taliban; Taliban to lack of civil will to fight, and open Terror. This should take one paragraph.</p>
<p>If India: your nut graph should be keywords: trade, growth, poverty, rights, political.<br />
If Pakistan: your nut graph should be keywords: turbulence, crisis, terrorism, US, failure.</p>
<p>Literary Value: For India, Established Male Fiction Authors should evoke example from a "classics" text here to peg. EMFAs for Pakistan do not exist, so you will necessarily be a One Book Author and should focus on evoking a White Author (preferably Russian writing in short pithy sentences about Chaos).</p>
<p>Human Interest Value: For India, Slums and Sexual Violence. For Pakistan, Persecution of Minorities, Terrorism *focused on Gender Abuses.</p>
<p>Concluding Paragraph for India must tackle what Modi's visit to US will mean, and how do we want to remind Americans that they do not care about 2002. For Pakistan, the failure of the civil regime to make the military regime destroy the terrorists that they created to destroy the civil regime and what it means for Syria? Iraq? The Pakistan op-ed has more room to maneuver but "drones" are not on the table this year.</p>
<p>Open Remarks: No history lessons people. 1947 and 2014 are the only two important years with 2001 and 2002 as regional markers. Please try to keep your attention focused away from un-necessary people centered debates and certainly do not go into "domestic" issues. I heard from someone that infrastructure (water and power), IMF payments and Saudi Arabia/China were important players but we really do not have the space in 800 words to tackle this. Make sure that your novel has a catchy title for the bio line!</p>
<p>* The chances that a female authored piece will get published are slim but do give it a shot, if you are genetically inclined.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the submissions.</p>
