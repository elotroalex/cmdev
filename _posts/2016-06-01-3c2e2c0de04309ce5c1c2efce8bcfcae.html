<p>hi, there has been a comment on your site for the past 9 years. I need this to be removed at it is linked to me and to my medical school and I did not write this comment. it was a malicious act by an ex partner whos surname is makhani- who the post makes reference to. Please could you delete this as when anyone searches for me on google this comes up and it is running my reputation as a doctor and reputable physician.<br />
please let me know if I you need any more information .</p>
<p>I trust that you will deal with this matter as soon as you can.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
