<p>Jacob Silverman, <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/books/where-the-wild-frontiers-are-america-comes-up-short-in-south-asia?pageCount=0">Where the Wild Frontiers Are: America comes up short in South Asia</a>, Sep 2, 2011, The National:</p>
<blockquote><p>A worthwhile political blogger doesn't have to always be right, but he or she should be able to remain sober in the emotional maelstrom of politics or amidst national trauma. Ahmed repeatedly does this, particularly when he summarises the problems with the commentary appearing after Benazir Bhutto's assassination. "There is never a hint of any legislative or political legacy, any economic or social accomplishment," he writes. "She is being remembered for who she was." Potentially unpopular, this analysis is also shrewd and penetratingly precise. Our world could use more of it.
