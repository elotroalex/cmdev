<p>As professional meetups go, AHA is less painful than COMDEX but slightly worse off, sartorially speaking (some of these sweaters - sheesh!). For the first time, in a long while, I attended panels and listened to scholars and thought about their words. My favorite <a href="http://aha.confex.com/aha/2009/webprogram/Session1837.html">panel</a> was a Silver Jubilee retrospective of Guha's <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=y5SrnXC-HNcC">Elementary Aspects of Peasant Insurgency in Colonial India</a> by Ranajit Guha - the book that launched a thousand careers. I especially appreciated the historiography of Gramsci (and later, the Subaltern Studies collective) in Latin America sketched by Greg Grandin. I hope I see it in print soon. </p>
<p>The AHA will have, for the first time, a South Asianist as the President this year, <a href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/history/facstaff/facultydetail.asp?ID=181">Barbara Metcalf</a>. And we also have a new caucus/affiliated organization <i>Society for Advancing the History of South Asia</i> which hopefully will have a new web-presence soon and may even do insane things like contribute to the <a href="http://archiveswiki.historians.org/index.php/Main_Page">Archives wiki</a>. Yeah? If you work on South Asia history, and this is news to you, please get in touch with Manu Bhagavan. Exciting.</p>
<p>Unluckily, I also got the flu. So much of the last two days have been spent hunkering deep inside my soul for any warmth. </p>
