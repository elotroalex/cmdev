  content: The despondency is  understandable but we need hope.

<p>Fanon wrote about why the anti-colonial struggle targeted doctors and intellectuals. It did so, he surmised, because the colonial doctor or the colonial ethnographer were not mere healers and intellectuals. They were also critical participants in the daily life of the colony; they had property, employed colonized bodies; the healers were torturers and the ethnographers were erasers of native pasts. For Fanon, the native doctor and the organic intellectual were the hope for the freed nation-- these figures who would carry the episteme of Europe through the burning colony, and assimilate the two. We now know that project to be just as flawed as the colonial one.</p>
<p>The mis-titled 'post-colonial' nation that emerged in 1947 bent its will to dominate Kalat, Kashmir, Swat, Bengal, Sind, Baluchistan. At each, they erased the organic intellectuals, the healers, those who could offer a narrative counter to their enlightened nationalism. Fanon's organic intellectuals were targeted and killed by the post-colonial state in 1971 in East Pakistan, in the 1970s in Karachi. The healers are being killed across Pakistan <a href="http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/pakistan/database/Shia_Doctor_killed.htm">right now</a>.</p>
<p>Today, as I sit and think about Sabeen Mahmud, my mind keeps going back to the state-sanctioned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_killing_of_Bengali_intellectuals">killing of intellectuals</a> in 1971. Why kill <a href="http://archive.thedailystar.net/suppliments/2006/december/december14th/loss.htm">Abul Khair</a> and Munier Chowdhury? They wrote. They taught. In the perverse logic of the nation-state, their ideas, their capacity to have a dialogue, were the very reasons for their eradication. There is only one idea, only one conversation, only one speaker.</p>
<p>I started to talk about Baluchistan <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/homistan/the_baluchistan_issue.html">here</a> when the insurgency started in 2005. Ten years later, the state has assassinated a number of leaders and over 3,000 have 'disappeared'. The Baluchi men, women and children <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/02/families-missing-baloch-march-justice-2014227101949360898.html">walked over 2,000 km</a> to see if someone can answer them. No one did. One of those marchers, Mama Qadeer, was the participant at the talk held in T2F, organized by Sabeen Mahmud. She was killed after the event. She was killed because she provided a forum for a conversation that cannot be held in Pakistan. It is a conversation that pits the <a href="http://www.dw.de/brahamdagh-bugti-china-pakistan-deal-usurps-balochistans-resources/a-18405846">dreams of a Chinese-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a> against local resistance. Just days before the T2F conversation, the <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1174886/outcry-on-social-media-as-lums-cancels-talk-featuring-mama-qadeer">State forced</a> LUMS University in Lahore to cancel their talk on Baluchistan. It is this re-scheduled talk that led to the death of Sabeen Mahmud.</p>
<p>There is no doubt in my mind that the Baluch cause will be crushed. Whether economic nationalism triumphs or the sacral one, does not really matter in the end. The corridors will be built over the hidden mass graves and the charred dreams of self-autonomy. With the murder of Sabeen Mahmud, there is the end of decade old space for dialogue in Karachi. That space is not coming back. No one is going to step forward and create such spaces anew. The killing of Sabeen Mahmud is the shattering of T2F. We can now cry and hold these broken shards as much as we like. But, to quote Faiz, there are no healers of glass.</p>
