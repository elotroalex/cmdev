<p>Wallace Stevens, "<a href="http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/blueguitar.html<br />
">The Man with the Blue Guitar</a>" (excerpts)</p>
<blockquote><p>
I</p>
<p>The man bent over his guitar,<br />
A shearsman of sorts. The day was green.</p>
<p>They said, "You have a blue guitar,<br />
You do not play things as they are."</p>
<p>The man replied, "Things as they are<br />
Are changed upon the blue guitar."</p>
<p>And they said then, "But play, you must,<br />
A tune beyond us, yet ourselves,</p>
<p>A tune upon the blue guitar<br />
Of things exactly as they are."</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>I cannot bring a world quite round,<br />
Although I patch it as I can.</p>
<p>I sing a hero's head, large eye<br />
And bearded bronze, but not a man,</p>
<p>Although I patch him as I can<br />
And reach through him almost to man.</p>
<p>If to serenade almost to man<br />
Is to miss, by that, things as they are,</p>
<p>Say it is the serenade<br />
Of a man that plays a blue guitar.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>Ah, but to play man number one,<br />
To drive the dagger in his heart,</p>
<p>To lay his brain upon the board<br />
And pick the acrid colors out,</p>
<p>To nail his thought across the door,<br />
Its wings spread wide to rain and snow,</p>
<p>To strike his living hi and ho,<br />
To tick it, tock it, turn it true,</p>
<p>To bang from it a savage blue,<br />
Jangling the metal of the strings<br />
<!--more--><br />
IV</p>
<p>So that's life, then: things as they are?<br />
It picks its way on the blue guitar.</p>
<p>A million people on one string?<br />
And all their manner in the thing,</p>
<p>And all their manner, right and wrong,<br />
And all their manner, weak and strong?</p>
<p>The feelings crazily, craftily call,<br />
Like a buzzing of flies in autumn air,</p>
<p>And that's life, then: things as they are,<br />
This buzzing of the blue guitar.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>Do not speak to us of the greatness of poetry,<br />
Of the torches wisping in the underground,</p>
<p>Of the structure of vaults upon a point of light.<br />
There are no shadows in our sun,</p>
<p>Day is desire and night is sleep.<br />
There are no shadows anywhere.</p>
<p>The earth, for us, is flat and bare.<br />
There are no shadows. Poetry</p>
<p>Exceeding music must take the place<br />
Of empty heaven and its hymns,</p>
<p>Ourselves in poetry must take their place,<br />
Even in the chattering of your guitar.</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>A tune beyond us as we are,<br />
Yet nothing changed by the blue guitar;</p>
<p>Ourselves in the tune as if in space,<br />
Yet nothing changed, except the place</p>
<p>Of things as they are and only the place<br />
As you play them, on the blue guitar,</p>
<p>Placed, so, beyond the compass of change,<br />
Perceived in a final atmosphere;</p>
<p>For a moment final, in the way<br />
The thinking of art seems final when</p>
<p>The thinking of god is smoky dew.<br />
The tune is space. The blue guitar</p>
<p>Becomes the place of things as they are,<br />
A composing of senses of the guitar.</p>
<p>VII</p>
<p>It is the sun that shares our works.<br />
The moon shares nothing. It is a sea.</p>
<p>When shall I come to say of the sun,<br />
It is a sea; it shares nothing;</p>
<p>The sun no longer shares our works<br />
And the earth is alive with creeping men,</p>
<p>Mechanical beetles never quite warm?<br />
And shall I then stand in the sun, as now</p>
<p>I stand in the moon, and call it good,<br />
The immaculate, the merciful good,</p>
<p>Detached from us, from things as they are?<br />
Not to be part of the sun? To stand </p>
<p>Remote and call it merciful?<br />
The strings are cold on the blue guitar.</p>
<p>VIII</p>
<p>The vivid, florid, turgid sky,<br />
The drenching thunder rolling by,</p>
<p>The morning deluged still by night,<br />
The clouds tumultuously bright</p>
<p>And the feeling heavy in cold chords<br />
Struggling toward impassioned choirs,</p>
<p>Crying among the clouds, enraged<br />
By gold antagonists in air--</p>
<p>I know my lazy, leaden twang<br />
Is like the reason in a storm;</p>
<p>And yet it brings the storm to bear.<br />
I twang it out and leave it there.</p>
<p>IX</p>
<p>And the color, the overcast blue<br />
Of the air, in which the blue guitar</p>
<p>Is a form, described but difficult,<br />
And I am merely a shadow hunched</p>
<p>Above the arrowy, still strings,<br />
The maker of a thing yet to be made;</p>
<p>The color like a thought that grows<br />
Out of a mood, the tragic robe</p>
<p>Of the actor, half his gesture, half<br />
His speech, the dress of his meaning, silk</p>
<p>Sodden with his melancholy words,<br />
The weather of his stage, himself.</p>
<p>XXX</p>
<p>From this I shall evolve a man.<br />
This is his essence: the old fantoche</p>
<p>Hanging his shawl upon the wind,<br />
Like something on the stage, puffed out,</p>
<p>His strutting studied through centuries.<br />
At last, in spite of his manner, his eye</p>
<p>A-cock at the cross-piece on a pole<br />
Supporting heavy cables, slung</p>
<p>Through Oxidia, banal suburb,<br />
One-half of all its installments paid.</p>
<p>Dew-dapper clapper-traps, blazing<br />
From crusty stacks above machines.</p>
<p>Ecce, Oxidia is the seed<br />
Dropped out of this amber-ember pod,</p>
<p>Oxidia is the soot of fire,<br />
Oxidia is Olympia.</p>
<p>XXXI</p>
<p>How long and late the pheasant sleeps<br />
The employer and employee contend,</p>
<p>Combat, compose their droll affair.<br />
The bubbling sun will bubble up,</p>
<p>Spring sparkle and the cock-bird shriek.<br />
The employer and employee will hear</p>
<p>And continue their affair. The shriek<br />
Will rack the thickets. There is no place,</p>
<p>Here, for the lark fixed in the mind,<br />
In the museum of the sky. The cock</p>
<p>Will claw sleep. Morning is not sun,<br />
It is this posture of the nerves,</p>
<p>As if a blunted player clutched<br />
The nuances of the blue guitar.</p>
<p>It must be this rhapsody or none,<br />
The rhapsody of things as they are.</p>
<p>XXXII</p>
<p>Throw away the lights, the definitions,<br />
And say of what you see in the dark</p>
<p>That it is this or that it is that,<br />
But do not use the rotted names.</p>
<p>How should you walk in that space and know<br />
Nothing of the madness of space,</p>
<p>Nothing of its jocular procreations?<br />
Throw the lights away. Nothing must stand</p>
<p>Between you and the shapes you take<br />
When the crust of shape has been destroyed.</p>
<p>You as you are? You are yourself.<br />
The blue guitar surprises you.</p>
<p>XXXIII</p>
<p>That generation's dream, aviled<br />
In the mud, in Monday's dirty light,</p>
<p>That's it, the only dream they knew,<br />
Time in its final block, not time</p>
<p>To come, a wrangling of two dreams.<br />
Here is the bread of time to come,</p>
<p>Here is its actual stone. The bread<br />
Will be our bread, the stone will be</p>
<p>Our bed and we shall sleep by night.<br />
We shall forget by day, except</p>
<p>The moments when we choose to play<br />
The imagined pine, the imagined jay.
