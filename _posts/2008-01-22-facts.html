<p><i>We came here from Georgia. Our family did. Horse and wagon. I pretty much know that for a fact. I know they's a lots of things in a family history that just aint plain so. Any family. The stories get passed over. As the sayin goes. Which I reckon some would take as meanin that the truth cant compete. But I dont believe that. I think that the when the lies are all told and forget the truth will be there yet. It dont move about from place to place and it dont change from time to time. You cant corrupt it any more than you can salt salt.</i> - Cormac McCarthy, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Country-Old-Men-Cormac-McCarthy/dp/0375706674/ref=ed_oe_p">No Country for Old Men</a>, p. 123.</p>
<p><i>A vigilant epistemology will guard here against the illusion of believing that what we call a fact coincides with what really happened, or with the living memory of eyewitnesses, as if the facts lay sleeping in the documents until the historians extracted them. </i>  - Paul Ricoeur, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Memory-History-Forgetting-Paul-Ricoeur/dp/0226713423/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1201007377&sr=8-1">Memory, History, Forgetting</a>, p. 178.</p>
