<p><a href="http://www.albanianliterature.com/html/authors/bio/kadare-i.html">Ismail Kadare</a>, who won the International Booker this year, has a short story in the 01.02.06 issue of the NYer, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/content/?051226fi_fiction">The Albanian Writers' Union as Mirrored by a Woman</a>. Do enjoy. In more than one way, it reminded me of Pamuk's <i>Snow</i>. While you are in the issue, please take time to read Laura Miller's profile of Philip Pullman, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/051226fa_fact">Far from Narnia</a>. The key graf:</p>
<div id="blockquoted">In his Carnegie Medal speech, he said, &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&ordm;We need stories so much that we&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;re even willing to read bad books to get them, if the good books won&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;t supply them. We all need stories, but children are more frank about it.&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&sup1; What angers Pullman most about theocracy, in the end, is that it blinds people to the true purpose of narrative. <i>Fundamentalists don&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;t know how to read stories</i>&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&reg;including those in the Bible&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&reg;metaphorically, as if they were Lord Asriel&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&acute;s imaginary numbers.
