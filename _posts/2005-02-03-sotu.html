  content: The poem disturbs me. It's probably supposed to. But I can't figure out
    why, which is also disturbing. There's something about the rhythm, in addition
    to the imagery... man, that's neat poetry.

<p><img src="/images/sotu.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>TV is on and volume set low. I am bustling for beds and bedtimestories. The Chosen One drones in and out. Ovations. Boos? Did I overhear grumbles? The dems have balls now? "...fill jobs Americans will not take" - go Brown Revolution. Personal Accounts. 2018. 2027. 2033. If he says 2046, I will take a shot, I promise myself. He doesn't. "...ownership" - hey! I vote yes for that! "...culture of Life" -uh oh. Amendment! James Dobson in da hizzy! "...force of human freedom" - sounds sinister, if you put it that way. Saudi Arabia, Egypt: Lady Liberty is on the phone for you. "...to the Iranian people"? put on the coffee pot on 'cause we coming over. "...freedom from fear".</p>
<p>Serendipitously, the bedtime poem is by <a href="http://www.c3.hu/~eufuzetek/en/eng/14/index.php?mit=weores">S&Acirc;&not;&acirc;&circ;&lsquo;ndor We&Atilde;&euro;&Atilde;&oelig;res</a>:</p>
<div class=quote><img src="/images/startquote.gif"><center><b>Monkeyland</b></center><br />
Oh for far-off monkeyland,<br />
ripe monkeybread on baobabs,<br />
and the wind strums out monkeytunes,<br />
from monkeywindow monkeybars.<br />
Monkeyheroes rise and fight<br />
in monkeyfield and monkeysquare,<br />
And monkeysanatoriums<br />
have monkeypatients crying there.<br />
Monkeygirl monkeytaught<br />
masters monkeyalphabet,<br />
evil monkey pounds his thrawn<br />
feet in monkeyprison yet.<br />
Monkeymill is nearly made,<br />
mills of monkeymayonnaise,<br />
winningly unwinnable<br />
winning monkeymind wins praise.<br />
Monkeyking on monkeypole<br />
harangues the crowd in monkeytongue,<br />
monkeyheaven comes to some,<br />
monkeyhell for those undone.<br />
Macaque, gorilla, chimpanzee,<br />
baboon, orangutan, each beast<br />
reads his monkeynewssheet at<br />
the end of each twilight repast.<br />
With monkeysupper memories<br />
the monkeyouthouse rumbles, hums,<br />
monkeyswaddies start to march,<br />
right turn, left turn, shoulder arms ---<br />
monkeymilitary fright<br />
reflected in each monkeyface,<br />
with monkeygun in monkeyfist<br />
the monkeys' world the world we face.<br /></center><img src="/images/endquote.gif"></div>
