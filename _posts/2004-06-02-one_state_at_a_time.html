<p><img src="/images/stephanie.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Rejoice! in the streets, if you will. South Dakota makes my day by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A6987-2004Jun1?language=printer">electing Democrat Stephanie Herseth</a> in that red state. It was a close election, no doubt, and Herseth will have re-compete in November. But, the important fact is that the Democrats are making in-roads into the red states. Kentucky led the way by <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/02/17/elec04.h.kentucky.ap/">electing Ben Chandler</a> in the first Federal Election of 2004. And as Steve can testify, Kentucky is a little "red". This augurs ill for Bush. Let November 2004 really be a referendum of GWB. Viva Kerry Republicans!</p>
