<p>We are off to see <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/hoover/">Hoover Dam</a>. Hopefully, it will re-ignite my faith in human engineering. Because, looking around Vegas with its heaps upon heaps of cookie-cutter houses and AquaVerdeVistas gated communities makes me ill.</p>
<p>Tonight is BBQ at Uncle Shazi who I haven't seen since 1992. </p>
<p>It's Hot!</p>
