    well, the cards won. what could be politically spun from that?

    i suggest reading over Salon.com's King Kaufman. he's been riffing on that other abomination  - talking head sports coverage. he had to be more sensitive this year and call out the entire fox crew, not just the ann coulter of sports, jeannie zelasko.

<p><img src="/img/damon.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Amazing. I don't really have any passion for the Red Sox - although they appeal to my inner demons. I do have a real passion against the Yankess. They appeal to everything I hate about organized sports in the US. </p>
<p>Last night, I went over to <a href="http://www.thatshortkid.com">tsk</a>'s crib and we enjoyed a multi-screen bonanza of God's Green Valley set right by Johnny Damon. </p>
<p>Two things.</p>
<p>1. Go read <a href="http://www.1984produkts.com/donkeyhottie/wordpress/archives/2004/10/21/why_not_us/">moacir</a> on the series. He says more than I ever can but would like to. I merely quote... </p>
<div class=quote><img src="/img/startquote.gif">And then&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&plusmn; And then. The Red Sox won. They fucking won. I couldn&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;t believe it. But I started to believe, at least a teeny, teeny bit. And that&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;s when I saw the sign for the first time in the monster seats: &acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&uml;WHY NOT US?&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&dagger; Why not have the Red Sox be the first team to force a Game 7 in MLB history after being down 0&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&plusmn;3? Why not have the Red Sox be the first team in MLB history to go 4&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&plusmn;0 in elimination games? Why not have the Red Sox beat the Yankees in the postseason? Why not? I knew this curse shit was garbage.<img src=/img/endquote.gif></div>
<p>2. If the Houston Astros win and there is a Red Sox v Astros World Series, the collective heads of Washington pundits will explode from inane metaphors of the state of the Union. God, please don't.</p>
