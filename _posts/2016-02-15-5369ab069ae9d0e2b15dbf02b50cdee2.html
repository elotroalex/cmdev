<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am a postdoc in the molecular genomics and Cell biology department at UChicago. I just read the following article:</p>
<p>http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/homistan/statement_of_solidarity_with_student_protests_in_india_from_students_of_the_university_of_chicago.html</p>
<p> and was wondering if it would be possible for me to have my name signed on in support too.<br />
Thank you. </p>
