  content: I also enjoyed "Harold and Kumar" - although NP Harris is very, very funny,
    the various dream/cartoon sequences are also disconcerting and funny.

  content: one of the mailing lists i am on received a chain letter from the actors
    who play harold and kumar asking that we see the film to uplift the (asian) race(s).  i
    was a bit repulsed at the niche marketing.  speaking of commodification of dissent
    and all that.

  content: interesting. can you post that letter here? i am interested to see the
    language...is it markedly different from viral marketing for "urban" movies where
    the black community is urged to show support for Barbershop 2 or something? can
    tom cruise start sending out letters to closeted white males with perfect teeth?

<p><img src="/images/h_k.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Busy today. I saw <a href="http://www.haroldandkumar.com">Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle</a> last night. I was hoping to catch it with my peeps but ended up going late and on a whim. After watching the movie - hilarious - we decided to go get some take-out from Chinatown. We then proceeded to drive <b>in a circle</b> around Chinatown for 30 minutes. It got absurd. I mean, we have been in Chicago 6 years and gone to Chinatown a gazillion times. Whatever. After we got home, I discovered that my Mongolian Beef was not-Mongolian and not-Beef. White Castle sounded really good at that time but I went to sleep.<br />
The movie, like I said, was hilarious. Perfect stoner jokes. Seeing a korean and desi guy as leads in a hollywood movie <b>is</b> disconcerting. Shouldn't be but we are programmed as audiences to see these ethnicities as side-kicks and comic relief. The script is smart (one of the writers, Hayden Schlossberg is a recent Uchicago alum - history, I think) in that it tweaks that expectation into having us immediately like the title characters and riffs on ethnic stereotypes throughout the movie. The overachieving asians, the racist cop, the rad skaters, the redneck woodsman, the servile indian and so on. The funniest thing in the movie, bar none, is Neal Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser, M.D.). I will attempt to see this again with a more "attuned" audience .<br />
This morning, I have been trying to lug through Nu'aym b. Hammad's apocalyptical <i>Kitab ul Fitan</i>. It is filled with gentle descriptions of the AntiChrist (Dajjal). I cannot concentrate. I am trying to find this apocryphal tradition that states, "Allah will protect two groups of my Umma from the fire of hell, One which will fight in al-Hind and one which will side with Jesus".<br />
I have a sneaking suspicion that I will not find it here.</p>
