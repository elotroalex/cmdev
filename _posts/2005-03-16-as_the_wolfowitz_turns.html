<p><img src="/img/bell_wolfowitz.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>In a move apparently designed to give instant aneurysm to anarchists everywhere, The Chosen One announced that Wolfowitz shall <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=585821">head</a> the World Bank. There are many ways to read this development. The first, and most obvious, reading is that this is a deliberate road-block thrown to subvert the pre-ordained beatification of <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/02/26/news/newsmakers/bc.people.bono.reut/?cnn=yes">Bono</a>. The White House had to have been worried sick about the true heart of Bono forgiving all loans to Africa or something. In Wolfowitz, they have found someone who won't just raise the interest rate but <i>invade</i> Africa to collect from World-Bank-loan-defaultin'-Mercedes-driving-Warrior-Kings. </p>
<p>The second, more nuanced, reading is that the Bush Doctrine is undergoing metamorphosis. From a hungry, hungry caterpillar of war to a sweet, little butterfly of democracy. The softening on Iran and the carrot/stick on Syria could presumably be seen as signs of non-aggression. We all know that Wolfowitz wanted Syria and Iran. If those invasions were still on the table, there is no way that Wolfowitz, the intellectual commander, could leave. But why? Well. About three weeks after the second inauguration, every President hears the word <i>Legacy</i>. Bushies, working on their own beatification project, are looking at a monotonous insurgency in Iraq, trillionish deficits and a Social Security Reform that is as popular with comedians as Clinton's Health Care Reform. So how does The Chosen One cement a lasting Rooseveltian legacy? Have freedom march across Middle East, yo. Go all tough diplomacy. James Bolton to UN; Basmati to State; and pack Wolfowitz off to glitzy dinners. </p>
<p>But, I can't even begin to do a real analysis. Y'all should go see <a href="http://cheznadezhda.blogharbor.com/blog/praktikesplace">Praktike</a> or <a href="http://modeforcaleb.blogspot.com/2005/03/burke-on-wolfowitz-and-war.html">Caleb</a>. They will have the dope stuff. Lately, the only thing I can think of is the <i>'Insha</i> literature in thirteenth century India. You guys want to hear about <i>rasail, maktubat, mufawazat, manshur, fath-nama</i>? Me neither. Yet, I have to write this damn chapter/conference paper which has to be delivered on Monday to the founding members of <i>American Orientalist Society</i> [1842]. I am a proud and recent member of said organization. You are allowed to be jealous.</p>
<p>Also, on tap are some changes for CM. Be forewarned. </p>
<p><b>update</b>: <a href="http://www.liberalsagainstterrorism.com/drupal/?q=node/600">Praktike</a> and <a href="http://modeforcaleb.blogspot.com/2005/03/atlantic-bridges-falling-down-falling.html">Caleb</a> come through like the champions of blogging that they are. Also, from inside the beltway came word that this post was mentioned on CNN TV. Anyone? Oh. I found the <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0503/16/ip.01.html">transcript</a>. Larry King, I am free friday night.</p>
