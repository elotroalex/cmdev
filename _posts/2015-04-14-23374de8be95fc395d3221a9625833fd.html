<p>I wanted to direct you to my short movie online that combats Islamophobia by highlighting the media's role in (mis)representation: Semiotics of Islam: A Primer For Kuffar. </p>
<p>Last week it was featured on Huffington Post as part of "Muslims in America."</p>
<p>You can also check out past coverage of the film on India.Com, Apogee Journal andon Asia Pacific Forum on WBAI.</p>
<p>The film premiered at the Queens World Film Festival in March.<br />
It screened at the Iowa City Documentary Film Festival and won an honorable mention.<br />
Next weekend, it will screen at the Muslim Writers Collective in New York City. </p>
<p>I wanted to know if chapati mystery would be interested in featuring it. Both the actor, Adeeba Rana and I are available for interviews if that helps!</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact me at any time!</p>
