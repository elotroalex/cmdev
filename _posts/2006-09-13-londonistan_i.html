    Hey, if the keyboards bother you, just <i>try</i> putting up with the layout hegemony that means, every time you do a Windows install, at least one app, or regularly enough the whole damned OS, wants your speechmarks to be dollar signs and you can't find the @! Why God why?



    Look forward to seeing you tonight. I'll be the one with green glasses trying to look all drunken-poet by reading a literary periodical while he waits for you. My pub choice was largely arbitrary so I hope you have no great expectations. We can always move on.. say, to Gandhi!

    about one thing.  note recent posts: Our Dancing Daughters AND Nella Larsen, Lady
    in the Water AND lg15, the library AND the department store, the new yorker AND
    my own socks/position as a reader, klimt''s adele AND aerin lauder.  and i used
    to be even worse about this.'

  content: I say for the Moonstone, a bowl of chilled vichysoisse with a few thin
    slices of slightly warm french bread and a glass of vouvray. But if Sepoy is going
    to write about it, I recommend some miniature cocktail kabobs with mint chutney
    and a ricotta raita infused with black peppercorns followed by a saketini chaser.

  content: Just finished the Moonstone 10 minutes ago and have found you (whoever
    you are)via google in an attempt to better understand something that was contained
    in the book which I feel is cloudy in my mind.  A few years ago, I must have come
    across a reason to read the book, now long forgotten, and have been copying down
    the title and author year after year in my agenda book's "things to read" list
    and have just recently remembered and found the book and quite liked it, but am
    sure there is more to why I was supposed to read it.  Perhaps something Idries
    Shah mentioned about it, but I can't be sure.  Any insights?

<p>There is something to be said for three Chicago graduates who meet in whatever part of the world and speak for four hours on matters political, literary, esoteric and...gossipy. I'd imagine any group of colleagues do the same. I'd imagine we do it far nerdier.</p>
<p>ps. all y'all oughta have read Wilkie Collins' Moonstone.</p>
<p>pps. if you go <a href="http://digitalurban.blogspot.com/2005/08/gandhi-tavistock-square-london.html">here</a> and play with the panaroma, it'd be just like if you were with me yesterday. briefly.</p>
<p>ppps. how the hell do you guys type on these funky euro keyboards.</p>
