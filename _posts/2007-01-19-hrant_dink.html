    Khab Martay Naheen,

    Khaab Dil Hain Na Aankhen Na Shaamen Keh Jo

    Reza Reza Huay To Bikhar Jaingay

    Jism Ki Maut Say Yeh Bhi Mar Jayengay



    Dreams do not die

    Unlike the heart or eyes or evenings

    Which pass away and disintegrate into nothingness

    Dreams live on when the body is no more.

<p>Hrant Dink, editor of <a href="http://www.agos.com.tr/">Agos</a>, was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/turkey/story/0,,1994476,00.html">killed</a> in Istanbul. Dink had been convicted by Turkish government and given a suspended sentence in Oct 2005 for 'insulting Turkishness'. His 'crimes' were an article in Agos and remarks after a conference wherein he reflected on being Armenian and being Turkish. You can read a summary of charges against him <a href="http://www.englishpen.org/writersinprison/prisoners/hrantdink/">here</a>. If you want to know more about the background - the Turkish-Armenian strife - you can read <a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/democracy-turkey/dink_3246.jsp">this</a>.</p>
<p>Dink is not the first, nor sadly the last, of those who give their lives for the truths they hold. May he rest in peace and may justice prevail.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="http://verbalprivilege.blogspot.com/2007/01/hrant-dinkler-olmez.html">elizabeth</a>'s post and also the translation of Hrant Dink's <a href="http://verbalprivilege.blogspot.com/2007/01/gvercin.html">last article</a>.</p>
