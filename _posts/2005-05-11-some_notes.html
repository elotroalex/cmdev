    <i>...a five part series on American Blacks.</i>

    I can't say I agree with all of it either.  Somewhat dubious fellow, that Abdul-Walid (trust me, I've known him for a while).  Interesting ideas, but to be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism.

  content: Both yours and Ralph's pieces on blogging were pretty good. Not so much
    idiot-proof as technophobe-friendly, which is a rare thing.

  content: 'Sepoy, i enjoyed the how-to-blog piece. I can see it now: hundreds of
    crusty historians, rolling up their elbow-patched sleeves, and diving in. Excellent
    news!'

    good piece, but here's a nitpick. i don't know if you can change it or not:

    "Usually a database (the most common database used is SQL) stores all of the content that is hosted on a server."

    i can only assume that you meant MySQL, as SQL is a language, not a database.

<p><img class="graphic" src="/images/briefnote.jpg"><b>Note:</b> Ralph Luker cements his name in the future history of blogging by writing a wonderful <a href="http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/Issues/2005/0505/0505tec1.cfm">article</a> for AHA's <i>Perspectives</i>. He was kind enough to recommend me for a <a href="http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/Issues/2005/0505/0505tec2.cfm">how-to</a> piece. While I am thrilled to see my name in AHA's publication, I am weirded out by the fact that it is not my dissertation that I am talking about. On the bright side, Carlo Ginzburg will remember that I spilled some coffee on him in the Classics Caf&Atilde;&circ;. Still, I would like to write a more detailed article on constructing a blog specifically for a class. Maybe. </p>
<p><b>Further Note:</b><a href="http://news.webindia123.com/news/showdetails.asp?id=81574&n_date=20050510&cat=India">"I used to be very angry earlier. But then I started supporting him so that he can register his name in the Guinness Book of World Records", said Pushkar Pandey, Deepak's friend.</a> That's around 4+ TXT messages per minute. Last month, I had over 300 SMSes and my phone-bill yelled at me for 2 days. I thought I was going over-board. But if Deepak Sharma can send 182,689 SMS in one month and get a 1400 page bill, I can sleep easy at night.</p>
<p><b>Also Note:</b> <a href="http://vernacularbody.typepad.com/">Abdul-Walid of Acerbia</a> just concluded a five part series on American Blacks. You should read the whole thing but read <a href="http://vernacularbody.typepad.com/vernacularbody/2005/05/owning_all_the_.html">this</a> for sure. I cannot say I agree with all but I recommend it all, very highly.</p>
<p>I am a tad busy the next few days. Even though I had a post about the beginning of the Uprising yesterday, I failed to put it up. And some more things are in the works.</p>
