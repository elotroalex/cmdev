<p>Reading the Chapati Mystery blog online and following its facebook feed has helped me to stay connected to the mitti of India. Even though i have migrated to other disciplines, i still am able to learn and absorb much about South Asian history, culture and literature. So, thank you very much for being a part of this process.</p>
<p>Secondly, i wonder what the process is to submit writing to Chapati Mystery? And if there is volunteer work to be done, how can i offer my services?</p>
<p>Best,<br />
