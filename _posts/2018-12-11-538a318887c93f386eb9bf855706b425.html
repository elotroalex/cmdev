<p>Hello Daisy,</p>
<p>I stumbled across this website, trying to find the copyright owner of a Norman Rockwell image.<br />
(The one where he is photographed with his Nehru painting.)<br />
Do you own the copyright for that image? I will explain more on email. I cannot attach images here.</p>
<p>(The Saturday Evening Post told me to contact Cris from Curtispublishing, who told me they own licenses for the Nehru illustration, not the photograph of it and Norman).</p>
<p>I didn't know about you, until now(!) I am surprised (and glad) to find that you understand Hindi/Urdu, too. (I'm Indian)</p>
<p>I also happen to have studied painting in the same institution Norman did (The Art Students League, New York) and in the very studio he'd have studied in (with the legendary instructor George Bridgman). It is numbered Studio 8, now.</p>
<p>I live in New Delhi, India. I went to study at the League when I was 19. I was there for two years, studying full-time under Dan Thompson.</p>
<p>Let me know about the copyright status (if you do). I can explain more and attach usage images, on real email.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!,<br />
