    re: "In unrelated news, I am going slowly insane."

    That's not good. Since we are reading your thoughts on things, loss of rational faculties doesn't strike me as unrelated...

    what's up?

<p><img src="/images/islamsurvey.jpg"/> A story on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/08/AR2006030802221_pf.html">WaPo</a> was picked up on MSNBC who had their own insta-polls. 60K respondents. And these are the elite with access to the internets. Or maybe they are Atheists! </p>
<p>Juan Cole, today, <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2006/03/bigotry-toward-muslims-and-anti-arab.html">commented</a> as well. I urge you to read Juan - as he does clear up some nonsense spewed out in the press. I don't have much to add nor the time. But, it would be good if we could get some, uh, religious types to step up to the plate and make some speeches and write some books or do jamaican reggae [see <a href="http://www.hasidicreggae.com/">Matisyahu</a>] or anything to balance the drumbeat of explosions and murders and burnings and anger that blankets the tv screens day in and night out.</p>
<p>In unrelated news, I am going slowly insane.</p>
