  content: Not so easily, my friend. You have to make amends (and if I remember correctly,
    your closet needs to do the same) by admitting your complicity in the colonial
    enterprise and forking over some restitution to this sufferer.

<p><img src="/img/madras.jpg" align=left hspace=6>I don't really want this blog to deteriorate down to me listing SPAM everyday but this is too damn good to pass over. This spam comes from <a href="http://www.jcrew.com/catalog/category.jhtml?id=cat57719&navAction=jump">J.Crew</a> touting their new summer collection. The ad copy was what caught my attention:</p>
<div id="blockquoted">When the tailors of Madras invented the lightweight Madras Patch Jacket, they discovered that the only thing that kept them cooler on a hot Indian day was a quick dip in the Ganges. This season, J.Crew has taken this fine loomed Madras Patch and sewn it into a special edition jacket, pants, shirts, hats and belts. So now you can stay cool and look cool, too. </div>
<p>Now how exactly does jacket-designing and dipping-in-da-ganges square? Regardless, that is ugh-liest thing I have ever seen. In defense of the tailors of Madras, it was the Scots Brigade and the 19th Light Dragoons - the first cavalry to come to India in late c. 18th- with their Scottish tartans uniforms that got re-interpreted and taken back to England. So, uh, as on my latest kick: Blame the Scots!! (this kick is due to my watching Niall Ferguson on CSPAN).</p>
