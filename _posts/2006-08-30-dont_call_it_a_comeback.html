<p>Yeah, don't. Still, I am back - a little earlier than announced. More or less. Around. I think I may have lost my bloggy-legs in the midst. Feeling a bit rusty. </p>
<p>So much to talk about. The England-Pakistan cricket fiasco. Iran. Bugti. Google Print. The rebirth of Cool. One at a time, shall we?</p>
<p>I will also have a very special announcement about a new houseguest who will shoulder some of the CM burden in the coming months. Very psyched about that. </p>
<p>Furthermore, CM got nominated for <a href="http://asiablogawards.com/?p=9">Best South Asia Blog</a>! Thanks to those who did the nomination. And, well. Go vote for me. </p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, we are floating in space. </p>
<p>ps. I just received an email: "I declare Baluchistan as independent country. - A Baluch". See what I mean? </p>
<p>pps. Just saw that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/30/books/31mahfouzcnd.html?ex=1314590400&en=103bfd65e67569b3&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">Naguib Mahfouz</a> passed away at the age of 94. What a tremendous loss.</p>
