<p>Pakistan has lost the <a href="http://us.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/06/28/pakistan.internet.reut/index.html">internets</a> due to "a serious fault in the <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/k/f/kfh122/Project3_report_files/Project3_Figure1.html">undersea cable</a> carrying data between Pakistan and the outside world".</p>
