<p>On this day in 1965, Malcolm X was assassinated. Slate has a wonderful <a href="http://todayspictures.slate.com/20060221/">collection of photos</a>.  You can also listen to his <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/malcolmxgrassroots.htm">speeches</a> and see more <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/malcolmxphotos/malcolmxphotogallery.htm">pictures</a>.
