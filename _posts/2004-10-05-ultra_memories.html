  content: 'umar: We left Qatar in ''83 or ''84. I am sure they kept it in re-runs
    until ''95. I remember they would have 5 HOURS of gents sitting in a circle chatting
    with one cartoon plus the wacky news. Damn Qatar TV. Of course, now they have
    al-Jazeera and are all cool and stuff.'

<p><img src="/images/ultraman.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>It's been BUSY. The class, in 6th week now, is kicking my ass. Job is a mad scramble. Advisor is chomping my ears off. And someone stole my iPod. A week or so ago, I went to Chinatown with Gerry to get some Joy-Yi in me. It was good. On the way back, he stopped at a chinese grocery store called Chinese Grocery Store or somesuch. Wandering the aisles, while Gerry bought 8 packs of lichi gummy bears, I happened across ULTRAMAN gum.<br />
One glance and it was like my entire childhood flashed before me. I had totally forgotten about it. Me and the brothers used to love watching Ultraman dubbed into Arabic on DohaTV or whatever it was called. There is something weirdly appealing about a Japanese man in tight rubber. Yes, that sounds perverted, but imagine me a wholesome child, will you? We would recast Ultraman laser ray encounters with the floppiest monsters you will ever see. Such great fun. </p>
<p>And, a few weeks ago Cha'nad had a post up about <a href="http://chanadbahraini.blogspot.com/2004/09/go-cabtain-majid.html">Captain Majid</a>. That was the other favorite. Along with <i>Abtal al Malaeb</i> - I don't even know which Japanese version that was? </p>
<p>And the London Review blog had a post up about <a href="http://www.lnreview.co.uk/books/diary/004391.php">Enid Blyton</a>. God, how many hours of my life I spend reading <i>The Famous Five</i> or <i>The Secret Seven</i> or <i>The Enchanted Forest</i> or nine-thousand other titles. In fact, my ENTIRE reason to learn english was in sixth grade when a girl gave me a copy of Famous Five and I wanted to impress her by showing my literary side. </p>
