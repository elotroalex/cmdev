<blockquote>In choosing this setting for the Ball, we have sought neither to excuse or dismiss any historical events, nor to support or challenge any interpretation now placed upon them. It is clear, however, that some people have found our reference to the British Empire to be distasteful. We are unhappy that any offence should have been caused; that was certainly not our intention. We have therefore decided to remove immediately the word &ldquo;Empire&rdquo; from the May Ball website and from all future promotional material.</p></blockquote>
