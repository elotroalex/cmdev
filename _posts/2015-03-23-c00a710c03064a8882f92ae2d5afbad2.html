<p>With its network of multilingual journalists, Courrier International selects, translates and provides French readers articles polls and reports, as well as newspaper cartoons and photographs, taken from 1500 foreign publications, websites, blogs&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;<br />
Every week in its magazine and every day on its website and applications, Courrier International offers a different look on international news, content you can't find anywhere else (rare languages and local press), and another point of view on the news in your country.</p>
