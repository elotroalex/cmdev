  content: Thanks for sharing news of this video. I am stunned by Barney's sudden
    death. It was comforting, sad and inspiring to see and hear him speaking with
    characteristic eloquence in English and Tamil at Berkeley, just a short while
    ago --and sharing his exciting work on Subramanya Bharati and the birth of Tamil
    modernity /oratory/political discourse.

<p>Bernard Bate (Barney to all) was a profoundly gifted scholar of Tamil language and an anthropologist. He was currently a <a href="http://shc.stanford.edu/humanities-center-names-2015-16-fellows">Humanities Fellow</a> at Stanford-- while being the HoS of Anthropology at <a href="https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/faculty/bernard-bate/">Yale-NUS</a> in Singapore. His sudden passing has left all of us who knew him and admired him and loved him in profound shock. He was 52. This is a great loss. Just a few days ago, he gave a wonderful talk at Berkeley on Tamil oratory.</p>

<p>Barney visited CM often and he commented with glee and I know that he liked the spirit and style of our work. Here is a tweet that captures his spirit well.</p>

<p>We will miss him. Our hearts go out to his family and friends.</p>
