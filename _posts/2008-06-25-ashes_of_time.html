<p>Film scholar David Bordwell's blog is about the only thing I read on film and this entry on <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/?p=2453">WKW's two versions</a> for <s>Ashes of Time</s> Days of Being Wild is just awesome read for us fans (of both Wong Kar Wai and David Bordwell).</p>
<p>I know, long post. But the end leads to another long post  - that I recommend highly - about <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/?p=2326">issues of preservation, and versions</a>.</p>
<p>Fascinating material.</p>
