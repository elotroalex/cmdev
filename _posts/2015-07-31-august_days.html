<p>Gentle readers,</p>
<p>It has been quiet, I know. I hope all of you are busy writing your books to keep your jobs, or to get new ones. It must be exhausting, and you have my sympathies. I published a review-essay in <em>Caravan</em> looking at four new books on 1947/Partition: the edited volume by Urvashi Butalia, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Partition-Long-Shadow-Urvashi-Butalia/dp/9383074779">Partition: The Long Shadow</a>, Anam Zakaria's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Footprints-Partition-Narratives-Generations-Pakistanis/dp/9351365514/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1438347397">The Footprints of Partition</a>, Nisid Hajari's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Midnights-Furies-Deadly-Legacy-Partition/dp/0547669216/">Midnight's Furies</a>, and Venkat Dhulipala's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Creating-New-Medina-Pakistan-Colonial/dp/1107052122/r">Creating a New Medina</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The histories and memories in the new books considered here are in tension with one another. They open up new archives, methods and understandings, just they continue to naturalise the incommensurability of the Muslim with India. It is evident in reading them that our need to understand the deep history of Partition is acute. Just as graveyards are segregated by communities, so are histories. In partitioned South Asia, the Shia, Sunni, Muslim, Hindu, or Assamese, Sindi, Baluchi pasts are also constructed to be separate. The histories we produce must acknowledge the burden of recognising difference and parsing it. For the subalterns, those adrift among borders, the fuller history of Partition remains unwritten. The Rohingya floating at sea are also part of the forgotten stories of Partition. They who once were Indian or Burmese or Pakistani or Bangladeshi are now of nowhere. Without land, they are also without history.</p></blockquote>
<p>Do <a href="http://www.caravanmagazine.in/books/between-lines-partition-history">take a look</a>, and do let me know what you think.</p>
