<p><img src="/images/sunday.jpg" align=left hspace=22 vspace=6>A few things to remind you how precious that sunday sun really is. It is gorgeous outside, so don't read these. Go play frisbee (in my defense, I am sitting in the sun as I type thanks to Airport Extreme).</p>
<ul>
<li>The Guardian brushes off the cobwebs and reveals details about <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1312484,00.html">Prescott Bush and Nazis</a>. The main crime seems to be profit-mongering from war. Sounds familiar.
<li>In the TLS, Tom Phillips gives us a brief review of a book about Israeli and Palestinian <a href="http://www.the-tls.co.uk/this_week/story.aspx?story_id=2108523">postcards</a>. Totalitarian regimes dig these postcards.
<li>The Boston Globe, lays out the <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2004/09/26/ready_for_his_closeup/">controversy</a> surrounding <i>Der Untergang</i>- a new film about Hitler's last days. Hitler tenderly kissing Eva is voyeuristic, the critics accuse. Well, they have more accusations than that.
<li>In the New York Press, an examination of our propensity to anticipate <a href="http://www.nypress.com/17/38/news&columns/feature.cfm">doomsday</a>. It appears we like world-ending scenarios because the not-world-ending realities are too disturbing to contemplate.
<li>But love is real, too. India Express tells that Pakistan granted <a href="http://www.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=36525">citizenship</a> to an Indian woman married to a Pakistani. Seems like The General and Sardar Ji talked about it.
<li>Chicago Tribune brings news of <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/printedition/chi-0409260556sep26,1,3174462.story?coll=chi-printnews-hed">Radio Arman</a>. A popular program lets young Afghani teenagers share their heartache with the listeners.</ul>
