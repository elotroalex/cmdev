<p><img src="/images/sunday.jpg" align="left"/>The World Cup, whenever it comes, becomes such a part of my everyday that I feel like I have always been watching it, that there is no time when I don't have another contest to look towards or examine after. I walked down the street, and in a shop window, they had a tv. A be-jeweled, track-suited, be-gelled gentleman was standing watching the game, green pitch covered in moving dots. I instinctively stopped. We watched it together for a solid 10 minutes, appreciating our mutual audience, exchanging non-verbal cues at the Italian flopping. This is what I love, and respect, about the WM - it makes us all instant co-spectators. (Btw, If you haven't been reading Zunguzungu's <a href="http://zunguzungu.wordpress.com/">posts</a> on the WM - please go now and make amends.) </p>
<ul>
<li>As usual, The Big Picture has <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2010/06/opening_weekend_-_2010_world_c.html">amazing photos</a> of the global spectator - including <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2010/06/opening_weekend_-_2010_world_c.html#photo40">this projection</a> on the Wall.
<li>In the LRB, Bernard Porter <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n12/bernard-porter/pariahs-cant-be-choosers">reviews</a> Sasha Polakow-Suransky's "well-researched, readable and (I think) balanced book", <em>The Unspoken Alliance: Israel's Secret Relationship with Apartheid South Africa</em>.
<li>David Shulman continues to be an inspiration - his <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2010/jun/13/after-flotilla-debacle/">essay on the Flotilla</a> in <em>NYRB</em> is an example of clear-sighted moral activisim.
<li>Also in review-land is William Dalrymple's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/jun/20/curfewed-night-basharat-peer-dalrymple">re-take</a> on Basharat Peer's memoir <em>Curfewed Night </em>. I say "re-take" because the opening is almost identical to Dalrymple's <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2008/may/01/kashmir-the-scarred-and-the-beautiful/">earlier essay</a> on Kashmir which anticipated Peer's memoir.
<li>Also in the memoir world is <a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/06/20/beneath_the_veil/">an interview</a> with G. Willow Wilson, comic book writer and traveller - on occasion of her <em>The Butterfly Mosque: A Young American Woman's Journey to Love and Islam</em>. God I hate all "___ the Veil" headlines.
<li><a href="http://radiofreemike.com/blog/">Michael Scott Moore</a>'s <em>Sweetness and Blood: How Surfing Spread From Hawaii and California to the Rest of the World, With Some Unexpected Results</em>, gets <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/books/review/Martin-t.html">reviewed</a>, and is on my pile of things to read for the summer.
<li>For the record, <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-06-15/a-bloomsday-celebration-by-joshua-cohen-author-of-witz/2/">All About H. Hatterr is insane</a> - but Happy (late) Bloomsday.
<li>The end of the Obama Dream is covered in two thoroughly depressing essays: Scott Horton in the <em>Harper's</em>, <a href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/2010/06/hbc-90007242">The Justice Department and the Torture of Maher Arar</a>, June 16 2010 and Tariq Ali's lecture, <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/2010/04/19/tariq-ali/obamas-war">Obama's War</a>.
<li>Depressed? Yeah, me too. The Oil Spill, the Ahmadi massacres, LIFE - it has been a rough entrance to summer but the comments on <a href="http://www.nypress.com/article-21357-bored-game.html">this post</a> made me realize that there always will be sunshine.
