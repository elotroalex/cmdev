<p>Here is how I introduced Jahangir <a href="http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/homistan/slow_burn_lahore_iii_this_is_my_culture.html">earlier</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>I walk down towards the rooms &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; there is an old man, in white wife-beater, a dhoti, and two fistfuls of shockingly white beard. He is sitting in front of a canvas on which is a bucolic village scene with a tube-well and a date palm. He looks up, and smiles, and kinda springs off the chair. He is wearing hipster glasses and he has only one tooth in his mouth, which is stained with nicotine or with paan.</p></blockquote>
<p>I spoke with reporter Rabia Mehmood, and she <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/377170/out-by-royal-park-the-soul-of-film-lays-dying/">followed up</a> and produced a wonderful video-essay that I urge all to see, since my words could not do justice to his colors.</p>
