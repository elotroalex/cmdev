  content: That's true, but not all media are created equal. Blogging is a medium
    which places a premium on linkages <i>as well as</i> message, as opposed to other
    written forms which are largely limited to message, and visual forms which are
    mostly devoid of textual content (I'm exaggerating, but you know what I mean).
