<p>Hi</p>
<p>My name is Khushboo and I'm a filmmaker from Bombay. I'm writing to you to talk to you about our new film, titled "An Insignificant Man", which premiered at Toronto International Film Festival last week. It will Play at the BFI London Film Festival on October 8th and 9th.</p>
<p>The film is a documentary about anti-corruption protestors trying to break into the biggest democracy in the world. Our protagonist Arvind Kejriwal and his Common Man's Party try to make their radical politics mainstream by talking about issues like crony capitalism and graft to show how inequality is engineered. As the film closes with elections, it also becomes a meditation on the dichotomy of idealism versus politics.</p>
<p>We seek to engage in conversation and criticisms around the social and aesthetic ideas in the film. We are sharing the film with writers who we think will help start interesting conversations. I have been a reader of Chapati Mystery for a long time and I feel you will find your hope for the absurd, and longing for apertures on a well-worn narrative, resonate within our film too. It would be great to see the film as you would see it.</p>
<p>The story has stark and interesting parallels with political movements and figures across the world, like Jeremy Corbyn, Bernie Sanders and Podemos. Cameron Bailey, Artistic Director at TIFF, said about the film, "Taking a rightful place alongside other great modern political documentaries such as The Revolution Will Not Be Televised and The Square, An Insignificant Man is a vivid document of India's fascinating political process."</p>
<p>The film has been backed by India's biggest crowdfunding campaign wherein we raised close to 600% of our initial ask. Additionally, we have been supported by Sundance and the Bertha BRITDOC Journalism Fund.</p>
<p>Here is a production trailer of the film:<br />

<p>Would you be interested in viewing the film? I can send you a screener. If you are in London, we will have a press screening soon as a part of the BFI film festival if you like. Do let me know.</p>
