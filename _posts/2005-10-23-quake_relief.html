    issued by SAQUAKE.ORG, a newly-formed relief alliance of \nSouth Asian American
    Professional and Non-Profit Organizations\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK, October 26, 2005
    &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&uml;
    In conjunction with today&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&yen;s
    international relief agency conference in Geneva, Switzerland, SAQUAKE.ORG today
    issued an urgent appeal for the United States and other leading world governments
    to urgently send much-needed helicopters, tents and other relief supplies to Northern
    Pakistan and Kashmir.\n\nAccording to UNICEF estimates, 10,000 children could
    die of hunger, hypothermia and disease within the next few weeks.  Many of these
    homeless are isolated with their surviving families in remote villages unreachable
    except by helicopter. As the Himalayan winter rapidly approaches, they are at
    risk of dying from hypothermia, disease and hunger.\n\n&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&circ;&laquo;Time
    is running out &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&uml;
    an additional 160 helicopters must be dispatched immediately to aid relief missions
    or thousands more will needlessly die, and only a handful of governments can make
    this happen.  We must step up now or forever regret our inaction,&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Iuml;&euro;
    said Dilawar Syed of the Organization of Pakistani Entrepreneurs of North America
    (OPEN).\n\nEarlier today, Senator Joseph Biden (D-Delaware) echoed this call,
    citing the need for the immediate shift of more &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&circ;&laquo;Chinooks,
    Blackhawk&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&yen;s

    across the border in Afghanistan.&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Iuml;&euro;
    \ Currently, there are an estimated 60 operational relief helicopters in Northern
    Pakistan and Kashmir and another 20 expected.  However, the United Nations and
    other relief agencies estimate an additional 160 helicopters are required to carry
    out a successful evacuation of earthquake victims.\n  \n&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&circ;&laquo;The
    United States must not miss a unique opportunity for public diplomacy with Pakistan,
    a key ally.  The Bush administration ultimately delivered much needed &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&uml;
    and appreciated &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&uml;
    Tsunami relief to Indonesia.  Now is the time to make a similar commitment to
    South Asia by supplying helicopters &acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&uml;
    and building goodwill in this important region,&acirc;&euro;&scaron;&Atilde;&bdquo;&Atilde;&para;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&lsquo;&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Iuml;&euro;

    charitable\n\norganization, which unites the physical and legal persons of Latvia
    and\n\nother states with the purpose of realization of charities in interests
    of a\n\nsociety of the States and special categories of the citizens.\n\n\n\nThe
    activity of Fund is distributed in territories of Latvia , Russian\n\nFederation
    and other states.\n\n \n\nThe basic purpose of activity of the Fund:\n\n \n\nAssistance
    to practical realization of the nation-wide, regional, local and\n\ninternational
    programs directed on improvement of social-economic situations\n\nand granting's
    the material and financial help in Latvia and other states.\n\n\n\nGranting the
    help to the citizens, who have suffered from natural calamity,\n\necological,
    technogenic disasters and other accidents. Assistance &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&Atilde;&nbsp;&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;&Atilde;&Dagger;\n\ndevelopment
    of public health services and protection of maternity and\n\nchildren, rendering
    help to liege and needy families.\n\n\n\nRealization of other measures of charity
    and granting.\n\n\n\nMutually with the states of Western Europe and Asian region
    to support other\n\norganizations in realization of the programs focused on the
    development of\n\nbusiness, tourism and recreation in LATVIA \n\nThe ways of realization
    of the charity: \n\nDisposable financial, material and other help; \n\nPermanent
    financial, material, and other help; \n\nFinancing the target programs following
    from the tasks of the Fund; \n\nRendering the charity help in accordance with
    agreements (contracts); \n\nDonation or sanction on gratuitous (preferential)
    use of objects of the\n\nproperty of Fund; \n\nRendering direct help by personal
    work, services or transferring of results\n\nof personal creative activity; \n\nGratuitous
    payment on complete or partial maintenance of objects of charity;\n\n\n\nOther
    measures, which are not forbidden by the Law. \n\n Good idea - Good word - Good
    business\n\n\n\nDistribution of the Humanitarian Aid\n\nCreating and developing
    our own system of rendering charitable support we realize perfectly well that
    it is not in our power to cover all the indigent people. Orphaned children and
    children without parental guardianship. Children from large or poor families,
    old people, disabled people, victims of Chernobyl catastrophe, refugees and migrants
    - there are categories of the population that badly need social protection and
    care. \n\nRendering support to indigent people is really a common cause. Practical
    activities that we carry out in this direction include receiving, customs clearance
    and further distribution of loads of charitable support among the organizations
    and institutions rendering social support to the population. \n\nClothes, shoes,
    food, linen, toys for children, school articles, medical equipment - this is not
    the whole list of loads that were received during our Fund's activity from Austria,
    the USA, Ireland, Slovakia, Italy. Thanks to the sincere and friendly support
    of our foreign partners thousands and thousands of citizens got the necessary
    material support in Latvia The organizations that regularly get our charitable
    support include local center rendering services to pensioners and single disabled
    people, children orphanages, hospitals, children pre-school institutions, public
    organizations for large families, disabled people, veterans of war and labour.
    \n\nA Russian proverb says that \"It is not only bread that feed a person\". \n\nWe
    realize that these are only joint efforts of all the charitable, public and religious
    organizations and state social services that give a possibility of a radical improvement
    of the social situation and we are always ready to collaborate. \n\nThe Fund deals
    with receiving loads of charitable support, distribution them among different
    organizations and establishments in order to give them to orphaned children, children
    from families of moderate means, victims of Chernobyl catastrophe, sic and old
    people and disabled people. In this way we help other organizations to render
    support to the most socially unprotected layers of the population. \n\nOur address\n\n

    and Economical Prosperity. It is a Purely Christian oriented Group working since
    1999 and set up to address the issues and challenges faced by the poor people
    especially socially, economically and culturally exploited people. God Foundation
    has observed that Government of Pakistan alone cannot do much for the poor people
    in urban and rural areas. Its activism is purely non-Valiance and Peaceful.\r\n
    \     God Foundation Regd. is non-government, non-profitable organization and
    working to uplift illiterate people through development programme and providing
    academic facilities to the very poor children and women. \r\nGod Foundation Regd.
    was started at grass root level to uplift the marginalize people especially in
    rural areas. This Foundation was formed in the year 1999 by the local people of
    Faisalabad and Registered by the Government in 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n(07) Description
    of the Project\r\nThis Project is situated in the city of Faisalabad, in the central
    area of the country in the largest Province called the Punjab. Faisalabad is an
    industrial city. Faisalabad is the third largest city in Pakistan. The majority
    of the inhabitants belong to the Muslim community. The Christian (Catholics and
    other Christian denominations) are a small minority living in harmony with the
    others. The Project involves the care and re-habilitation of children severely
    affected by polio and who have been neglected due to poverty and who have been
    unable to treat these affected children.\r\n \r\n(07.1) The Origin of the Project\r\nA
    Christian well-to-do lady belonging to the Church of England and who had been
    living in Pakistan for very many years had left a house for charitable purpose.
    This was part of her Will and with strict instructions that this house should
    be only used for charitable purpose, preferably to care for neglected and physically
    handicapped Children.\r\n\r\nGod Foundation open the charitable centre for disabled
    and physically handicapped children. The House was renovated in 1980 and began
    on a very small scale with few children. During the course of the years many affected
    children have been admitted and treated medically with success. A few Muslim children
    have also been admitted and everything possible is being done to care and assist
    them.\r\n\r\n(07.2) The Beneficiaries\r\nSince God Foundation helping these Crippled
    Children from the very beginning has not made any distinction in the choice of
    physically handicapped children, the centre admitted children from both the Christian
    and Muslim communities. The atmosphere is very cordial and they live like brothers
    and sisters. At present we have 42 disabled children between 4 to 8 years of age.
    There are many more requesting admissions but financially we are unable to admit
    them. Since the inception of this Institution we are happy to announce to you
    that over 1647 children have been restored to normal life and the parents are
    grateful for the assistance granted them. There have been advanced cases that
    could not be fully cured but are able to live happily with this defect in their
    families and be content with partial cures. \r\n\r\n(07.3) Situation of the Project\r\nThis
    Institution is a centre where love and dedication is the primary aim of the Staff.
    This centre radiates a genuine mission of Christian witness. It is a very difficult
    mission but the dedication of the this Foundation and the lay staff is greatly
    appreciated by all who visit these children, both from the Christian and Muslim
    communities.\r\n\r\nGod Foundation and the lay Staff devote their entire life
    in caring and tenderly looking after these unfortunate children. All those who
    visit the Institution show real human concern and do help with donations of food
    and other essential commodities.\r\n\r\nThese disabled children attend regular
    school in the centre and we have found out that many of them are intelligent and
    hardworking.  The majority is keen in studying and all efforts are made to help
    them. \r\n\r\n\r\n(07.4) Our financial commitment is our main concern\r\nOur main
    concern is the heavy expenses we incur in providing the essential requirements
    for these children. The main items that are very expensive are the following:\r\n\r\n#
    \ Medicines of various kinds for oral and external use.\r\n\r\n# Special types
    of shoes and other instruments that are used to help them move and walk gradually
    while been treated and assisted.\r\n\r\n#  Walking material and walkers to help
    in their movements.\r\n\r\n#  Braces and other items to assist them in their movements
    and mode of communication.\r\n\r\n# Medical help for their operations and particular
    treatment in the post operation period.\r\n\r\n# Food and nutrition for sustaining
    \ them in good health.\r\n\r\nAll the artificial means of assistance mentioned
    above are locally produced but very expensive. These children come from very poor
    family backgrounds and do not pay any thing financially for their board, lodging
    or treatment. We have to provide everything to help them walk again and be cured.
    God Foundation has to make constant requests for financial assistance from donors
    and friends, but this is not sufficient to cover the over all expenses.\r\n\r\nThis
    is the main reason we are requesting financial help from your Agency in order
    to make ends meet and not let these unfortunate children be deprived of care and
    medical help to their limbs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(08) Cost of Running the Institution
    for one year\r\n\r\nFood and Lodging   Rs. 300.00 x 42 x 12\t\t\t\t151,200.00\r\nAverage

    health. We hope you would extend your love and sympathies for these more deserving
    people.  I am very happy to invite you to please visit us any time. We also request
    for donation for incoming Christmas. You can send your donations through the Western
    Union.\r\n\r\nMay God pour out His abundant Blessings upon you all. \r\n\r\nYours
