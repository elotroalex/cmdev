<p>Hello there, </p>
<p>Hope you are well. </p>
<p>I have been following your website and social media posts for several years and enjoy and learn a lot from this engagement. I read that you encourage younger scholars to contribute to the website and so was wondering if you may be open to the idea of having a CM roundtable around Dr. Pippa Virdee's "From the Ashes of 1947: Reimagining Punjab". The book is published by CUP and I feel is an important contribution to the historiography on 1947. </p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you. </p>
<p>Best, </p>
