<p>Grapevine says that in all the hubhub in Fallujah, the US is <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/WO0404/S00164.htm">shipping WMDs<strong> into</strong> Iraq</a> in trucks with fake Saudi and Jordanian license plates. I would never pay attention to that. I maintain that people are too damn dumb to conceal ANYTHING. When they do try, they come up with the most implausible scenarios ever! Case in point, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/04/19/spacey.london/index.html">Kevin Spacey</a>. It is so obvious that this man was engaged in consensual park activity of the oral nature with the "mugger". After the deed was done, Mr. Spacey panicked that The Sun would be carrying details about the story in the morning. So he probably threatened the young gentleman with a mugging story and went running to the bobbies to create the cover story. In the end, the whole thing blows up in his face (!) and he retracts with a "i tripped on my dog".<br />
That is ridiculous, you say? Yes, it is. I am just pointing out that the cover story sucks (...) and that if this WMD story is true and the weapons are being planted then that cover story will be EVEN lamer and will blow up in the neo-con faces.<br />
However, that is not to say that I don't think they won't try it anyways.<br />
So, if there is any WMD news between now and November, lets all take the Kevin Spacey test to the cover story.</p>
