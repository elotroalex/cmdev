<p>Hello good people of Chapati Mystery. </p>
<p>Since January 2015, I've been researching the Omani xanith -- a male with effeminate characteristics, who is sometimes called transgender, alternative gender, third gender, etc. Theory around them felt insufficient, so I tried to sketch another path through xanith history and I've written an essay (a long one) looking at the anxieties between Qaboos, Oman's current ruler, and his father, the Omani Empire, the Swahili coast and Arab sexual attitudes, the ship as a homosexual institution, the boy-wive of the South African mining compound, xanith internet chat rooms, and a look at the Emirati novel, The Diesel, about a transgender performer. </p>
<p>The essay argues that the xanith, who is somehow understood to be native to Oman, is actually a figure that was born on the ship through commercial and imperial transactions of the Indian Ocean. Further, the essay reveals the different points of access, ie power, that males are granted by illustrating this constellation of male-to-male behavioral dynamics.  </p>
<p>I am almost finished with the essay -- need to clean it up a bit -- and I would really love it if you could consider it for publication at CM. I know it is not something you do regularly, but think it might fit really nicely. Would love to hear your thoughts!</p>
<p>best to you--<br />
