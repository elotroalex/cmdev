After Ryan's public <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2102857/">outing</a>, they have been turned down by almost every leading contender for the Senate bid (all hedging their bets for the 2006 Governor's race) to the degree that a cigar-chomping, bad hipped, SUV driving <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/brown/cst-nws-brown14.html">Da Coach</a> could be Da Candidate.

I do want to say that even though Ryan looked like a sleazeball (remember the <a href="/archives/straw_polls/stalk_obama.html">video stunt</a>?) to me from Day One, I was disappointed that he dropped out. Whatever he did with his wife was his business and people in glass houses ... . Still, the only man for US Senate seat from Illinois, for me, is <a href="http://www.obamablog.com/">Barack Obama</a>. He is, dare I say, an intellectual! and a liberal! oh my. Such bad words for the American public. Even with Ryan in the race, Obama was polling far ahead. Now, he is a shoo-in.<br />
And the DNC seems to share my enthusiasm for Obama. He will be giving the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A49457-2004Jul14?language=printer">Keynote address</a> during primetime at the Convention. I don't know how rare it is that a  <b>candidate</b> for public office gets such a spotlight but here it is.<br />
