  content: It's not a "powerful" call, it's an inciteful one.  And I think the intent
    was there.  It's not that the film was a big red button, it's that the makers
    of it obviously wanted to make this button in the first place, and dare someone
    to push it.

<p><img src="/images/submissmovie.jpg" align=left hspace=6 vspace=6>Some follow up. The docu/movie that got Theo Van Gogh killed can be seen on <a href="http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2655656">iFilm</a>. </p>
<p>Via <a href="http://yonathanbert.blogspot.com/2004/11/if-you-want-to-read-good-comments-on.html">Dutchblog Israel</a>, I learned of a <a href="http://www.peaktalk.com/">blog</a> that seems dedicated to following this pretty closely. </p>
<p>Looks like the Dutch police have finally taken more <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/11/10/netherlands.raid.ap/index.html">suspects</a> in.</p>
<p>MWU! has an <a href="http://www.muslimwakeup.com/mainarchive/001506.php">entry</a> that condemns the killing as well as the film. Now that I have actually seen the film, I think that for any jihadi, it is like a big red button with "DON'T PUSH" written on it. The call is too powerful. I personally don't think it accomplishes what it set out to do, which is to present a feminist critique of religious/cultural practices. The camera lingers on the exposed flesh a bit too long for my taste (which could just be the difference between American and European sensibilities. We might be programmed to notice nudity more starkly than the dutch). Whatever. No one needed to die for this. </p>
<p><b>update</b>: Violence against <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/story.jsp?story=580641">mosques</a> and retaliations against <a href="http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Guardian/0,4029,1347629,00.html">churches</a>.</p>
