  content: Yeah, but <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/18/national/18lakewood.html?ex=1279339200&en=376466c2ac4c8e57&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss"
    rel="nofollow">this</a>makes me think that charismatic evangelicals have found
    their Deepak Chopra. Which can only be a good thing.

  content: I know blackwell had absentee ballot in my county thrown out. I just wonder
    if mine was tossed as well? I once drove past the world harvest church on a sunday
    afternoon, I thought that the exiting congregation might decide to either convert
    me right there in my car or crush me with their giant Ford Trucks.

<p>In the long answer to Sepoy&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;s question of what the fuck is up with <a href="/archives/imperial_watch/religion_in_america_i">religion in America</a>, I mentioned evangelist <a href="http://www.breakthrough.net/">Rod Parsley</a> as unknown, but should-be-known by people who care about such things as democracy, freedom, religious plurality and the rise of the Christian Right.</p>
<p>While we still sleep here in North America to the designs of the folks working among us, I thank the Beeb World Service Newshour for pointing out Parsley and his <a href="https://www.centerformoralclarity.net/">agenda</a> to listeners of NPR, PRI and the BBC. Parsley is on an &acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Acirc;&uml;American Tour&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&Atilde;&dagger; encouraging the founding of a new political party based on pseudo-Christian tel-evangelical quasi-charismatic principles&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&yen;the Christocrats. Before you laugh, consider that World Harvest Church, Parsley&acirc;&circ;&scaron;&acirc;&permil;&nbsp;s Vaticanette, registered 100,000 voters before the election, and hosted polls in their lobby. Many evangelicals in the state thank him, and Blackwell, for swinging the election to Bush.</p>
<p>Readers of CM, I shit thee not. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/ram/0700.ram">Listen</a>:</p>
