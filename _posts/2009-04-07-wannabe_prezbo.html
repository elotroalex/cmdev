<p>Back when <i>The Wire</i> was ending its run, the Freaknomics blog hosted Sudhir Venkatesh watching the tv serial with some "real thugs". The first post had too much <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/what-do-real-thugs-think-of-the-wire/">smarm</a> for me to continue following it (Warren Buffet? WTF? It's RUPERT MURDOCH, dude).</p>
<p>I forgot and moved on. But after reading TR's damning review of his memoir/book, <a href="http://tenured-radical.blogspot.com/2009/04/puff-magic-sociologist-review-of-sudhir.html">Gang Leader for a Day</a>, I went back to see how those blog-posts had continued. Yeah, not so <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/28/what-do-real-thugs-think-of-the-wire-part-eight/">good</a>. </p>
