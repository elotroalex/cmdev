<p>Venting about Bernard Lewis is one thing, putting words in his mouth is another. The supposed quote, "I believe that one of the things you've got to do to Arabs is hit them between the eyes with a big stick," isn't real. It's just Brent Scowcroft's crude rendition, told to Jeffrey Goldberg, of what he imagined Lewis was telling Cheney (and Scowcroft would not have been in that room). So it's not a real quote, and any careful reader or listener of Lewis would have known that.<br />
